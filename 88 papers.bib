	abstract = {The Jehol Biota, preserved in the lacustrine sediments of Liaoning Province, northeast China, has provided a new window for understanding Early Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystems. Based on recent geochronological and biostratigraphic studies of the fossil-bearing deposits, a preliminary temporal framework has been established and suggests that the Jehol Biota had lasted for at least 11 Ma during the late Early Cretaceous (131–120 Ma). The development of the Jehol Biota can be divided into three major phases, with the most significant biological radiations occurring in the second phase between the Barremian and Aptian (approximately 125 Ma). Thanks to a diverse forest environment, major vertebrate groups, i.e. pterosaurs, dinosaurs, birds and mammals, in the Jehol Biota are characterized by a remarkably high percentage of arboreal and herbivorous forms. In addition to strong phylogenetic and morphological differentiation and high taxonomic diversity, the Jehol Biota is also characterized by significant dietary differentiation and biological interactions, i.e. competition and co-evolution between various animal groups, in an environment shaped by tectonic activities and palaeoclimatic changes both at a global and local scale.

	abstract = {Huckenholz (1963) showed that the original arkose and graywackeoverlap completely in both texture and composition; perhaps suppression of one or both terms is indicated. Graywacke has the longer, if not more significant (albeit confused), history. For 100 years in Germany and 50 in Britain, before development by Sorby of thin section petrography, graywacke was used as a purely hand specimen term based chiefly upon texture. It seems pointless to change this emphasis for an important, large, texturally-similar yet compositlonally-varied rock clan. Modal analysis and interpretation of immature sandstones presents many problems, especially that of matrix which is increasingly attacked as a classificatory parameter, chiefly of maturity. But it matters not how or when conspicuous matrix of graywackes formed for it to be useful for descriptive "coarse" separation of pure (arenite) and impure (wacke) sandstones; genesis of fine material must be interpreted in any sand, recent or ancient. Finer subdivision can be made on a compositional basis following flexible schemes such as Gilbert's. Sedimentary structures, tectonics, provenance, depositlonal process and environment should be avoided in petrographic classification. If textural and compositional maturity be accepted as the prime guides in classification, then purely quantitative placing of a rock within each maturity spectrum could replace all troublesome varietal names.},

It has been proposed that the filamentous integumental appendages on several theropod dinosaurs are primitive feathers2,3,4,5,6; but the homology between these filamentous structures and feathers has been disputed7,8,9, and two taxa with true feathers (Caudipteryx and Protarchaeopteryx) have been proposed to be flightless birds8,10. Confirmation of the theropod origin of feathers requires documentation of unambiguously feather-like structures in a clearly non-avian theropod. Here we describe our observations of the filamentous integumental appendages of the basal dromaeosaurid dinosaur Sinornithosaurus millenii, which indicate that they are compound structures composed of multiple filaments. Furthermore, these appendages exhibit two types of branching structure that are unique to avian feathers: filaments joined in a basal tuft, and filaments joined at their bases in series along a central filament. Combined with the independent phylogenetic evidence supporting the theropod ancestry of birds11,12,13, these observations strongly corroborate the hypothesis that the integumental appendages of Sinornithosaurus are homologous with avian feathers. The plesiomorphic feathers of Sinornithosaurus also conform to the predictions of an independent, developmental model of the evolutionary origin of feathers14.},

Two leg skeletons from the same site also show an Archaeopteryxlevel of morphology, and provide the earliest indisputable evidence for a covering of body contour feathers. These specimens provide evidence for either an undiscovered pre-Archaeopteryx or a rapid, post-Archaeopteryxevolution in birds. As the first Jurassic birds to be described from outside Germany, they show that birds with long fingers terminating in large recurved claws were widely distributed. They are not found in the Early Cretaceous sediments of the same region, where there is a diverse assemblage of more advanced flying birds with smaller fingers and claws. The postcran-ial structure of Archaeopteryx {andConfuciusornis} seems to be adapted for climbing tree trunks and may have disappeared near the end of the Jurassic.},

	abstract = {Widespread, geologically fast ({\textless}500 kyr) shallow-marine glaucony formation during the Cretaceous greenhouse world has no recent analogue. A detailed investigation from the Upper Turonian Danubian Cretaceous Group (southern Germany) links authigenic marine glaucony precipitation (Großberg Formation) to the intense chemical weathering in the catchment of a supplying river system (Seugast Member, Roding Formation). Nine glauconitic facies types within the Großberg Formation reflect a mixed shallow-marine depositional environment with land-derived siliciclastics, marine-carbonates and authigenic glaucony. X-ray diffraction analyses confirm these authigenic green grains and matrix as glauconitic minerals. The very high values of the modified chemical index of alteration (mean {CIX} between 86 and 92) demonstrate that the catchment area of the Seugast River was deeply chemically weathered and leached. In comparison to the hydrochemistry of modern tropical streams, massive Late Cretaceous nearshore glaucony formation was promoted by the riverine flux from the deeply chemically weathered, wet-continents amply supplying essential elements (Fe, Si, K and Al), fuelling shallow-marine glauconitization. The sequence stratigraphic calibration of the shallow-marine to continental transect of the Großberg Formation and the Seugast Member, corresponding to the Late Turonian depositional sequence {DS} Tu 5, further demonstrates that Late Cretaceous glaucony formation was a fast process ({\textless}500 kyr).

	abstract = {The scarcity of well-preserved and directly dateable sedimentary sequences is a major impediment to inferring the Earth’s paleo-environmental evolution. The authigenic mineral glauconite can potentially provide absolute stratigraphic ages for sedimentary sequences and constraints on paleo-depositional conditions. This requires improved approaches for measuring and interpreting glauconite formation ages. Here, glauconite from a Cretaceous shelfal sequence (Langenstein, northern Germany) was characterized using petrographical, geochemical ({EMP}), andmineralogical ({XRD}) screening methods before in situ Rb-Sr dating via {LA}-{ICP}-{MS}/{MS}. The obtained glauconite ages ({\textasciitilde}101 to 97 Ma) partly overlap with the depositional age of the Langenstein sequence (±3 Ma), but without the expected stratigraphic age progression, which we attribute to detrital and diagenetic illitic phase impurities inside the glauconites. Using a novel age deconvolution approach, which combines the new Rb-Sr dataset with published K-Ar ages, we recalculate the glauconite bulk ages to obtain stratigraphically significant ‘pure’ glauconite ages ({\textasciitilde}100 to 96 Ma). Thus, our results show that pristine ages can be preserved in mineralogically complex glauconite grains even under burial diagenetic conditions (T {\textless} 65 °C; {\textless}1500 m depth), confirming that glauconite could be a suitable archive for paleo-environmental reconstructions and direct sediment dating.},

The intra-Coniacian unconformity at the northern basin margin proves tilting of the basin floor to the south-east and is possibly related to the development of the thrust too. The Santonian to Campanian unconformities at the Harznordrand Thrust reflect the formation of a continuously growing fault-propagation fold. Deposition above unconformities occurred when the rate of eustatic sea-level rise exceeded thrusting rate. Transgressions occurred in the earliest Middle Santonian, in the Late Santonian (intra-Marsupites Zone), in the earliest Campanian (granulataquadrata Zone) and in the late Early Campanian (Offaster pilula Zone).

	abstract = {The sequence stratigraphic and sedimentologic analysis of a 180-km nearshore ({SSE}) to outer shelf ({NNW}) transect shows the pulsatory nature of the ‘Cenomanian transgression’ in northern Germany. Five complete and the lower part of a sixth third-order depositional sequence can be recognized: {DS} Ce I and {DS} Ce {II} (Mantelliceras mantelli Zone); {DS} Ce {III} (Mantelliceras dixoni Zone; {DS} Ce {IV} (Cunningtoniceras inerme to lower Acanthoceras jukesbrownei Zone); {DS} Ce V [Acanthoceras jukesbrownei Zone to Calycoceras (P.) guerangeri Zone]; {DS} Ce {VI} (Metoicoceras geslinianum Zone to lower Turonian). In inner and mid-shelf settings, sequence boundaries are mostly represented by stratigraphic gaps. A major sea-level fall occurred at the Early/Middle Cenomanian transition (sequence boundary {SB} Ce {III}). Maximum transgression during the Cenomanian is indicated by the deposition of homogeneous pelagic sediments of the ‘Poor rhotomagense Limestones’ (Late Cenomanian sequence {DS} Ce V). Graphic correlation of the sections investigated with a composite standard suggests that the inner and middle shelf sections were strongly controlled by available accommodation space during the Early and Middle Cenomanian. From the late Middle Cenomanian, non-accommodation controlled deposition of the ‘Poor rhotomagense Limestones’ occurred across the whole of the transect. Apart from the third-order depositional sequences, a hierarchy of stacked higher frequency (fourth- to sixth-order) cycles can be recognized. The basal elements are sixth-order cycles, represented by dm- to metre-scale marl-limestone ‘precession couplets’. Fifth-order cycles are represented by bundles of four to six couplets separated by dark marker marls, inferred to record the ca.100ky short eccentricity cycle. Fourth-order cycles are sets of four (three to five) fifth-order cycles. Their boundaries are significant erosion surfaces associated with subordinate sea-level fall, occasionally coinciding with third-order sequence boundaries. Most of the ‘classic’ Cenomanian bioevents can be accommodated into the sequence stratigraphic framework. Three main types of bioevents are recognized: ‘onlapping bioevents’ at the transgressive surface or in the early transgressive systems tract, ‘maximum flooding bioevents’, and ‘late highstand bioevents’. Onlapping and late highstand bioevents developed mainly either in response to sedimentologic and taphonomic processes such as winnowing and condensation, or owing to faunal migration during transgression. Maximum flooding bioevents are related to blooms of specialist taxa adapted to low food supplies and low-energy conditions. Two contrasting sedimentary systems can be recognized based on the nature of the dominant planktic carbonate component: an Early to early Middle Cenomanian ‘calcisphere system’ (‘Pläner’), characterized by high {CaCO}3accumulation rates (up to 80m/my), a relatively high input of terrigenous material, and dense macroinvertebrate faunal communities; and a late Middle and Late Cenomanian ‘coccolith system’ (‘Poor rhotomagense Limestones’), characterized by low {CaCO}3accumulation rates (13–18m/my), low terrigenous input, and impoverished benthic communities. The ‘calcisphere system’ is interpreted to reflect eu-/mesotrophic middle shelf ‘green’ water masses with high primary productivity and high food supplies supporting a rich suspension- and deposit-feeding benthos. The ‘Poor rhotomagense Limestones’ document deposition from a low-productivity, oligotrophic outer shelf water mass (oceanic ‘blue water’). The change between the two systems was caused by the Middle Cenomanian transgression, associated with the breakdown of shelf-front systems and the onlap of stratified, ‘oceanic’ water masses. The strongly reduced surface water productivity of the oligotrophic ‘coccolith system’ resulted in the disappearance of dense benthic communities during the late Middle and Late Cenomanian.},

	abstract = {A facies analysis of the epicontinental marine Cenomanian sediments of northern Germany shows the presence of 17 facies types ({FTs}, including several subtypes) which can be assigned to three facies associations: 1) an inner shelf facies association ({FT} 1–8) with high amounts of terrigenous material and/or high-energy depositional features, 2) a middle shelf facies association ({FT} 9–15) of predominantly calcareous sediments with moderate amounts of generally fine siliciclastics, and 3) an outer shelf facies association ({FT} 16–17) of low-energy, fine-grained, pure limestones. These three facies associations roughly correspond to the well-known lithological units of the Cenomanian of northern Germany, i.e., the Essen Greensand/Cenomanian Marls complex, the Pläner Limestones, and the Poor rhotomagense Limestones. The sediments were deposited on a northward-dipping homoclinal ramp with more-or-less shoreline-parallel facies belts. The sediment composition on this ramp-like shelf was a function of the varying importance of three different sediment sources: 1) terrigenous input from the south (Rhenobohemia), generally fining/decreasing in a proximal–distal (i.e., S–N) direction; 2) production of skeletal grains, mainly by macrobenthic organisms; and 3) settling of planktic carbonate (mainly calcispheres and calcareous nannofossils). In response to decreasing water energy with increasing water depth, the seaward decreasing terrigenous influence, and increasing planktic carbonate production, increasingly finer and more calcareous sediments were deposited in a proximal–distal transect. This rather straightforward picture was slightly modified by highest carbonate accumulation rates (planktic and benthic) on the middle shelf, forming a mid-shelf depocenter (fossiliferous, calcisphere-rich Pläner Limestones). Time-transgressive, southward-directed onlap of this biosedimentary system during the Cenomanian caused a significant retreat of the coastline towards the south and a retrogradational stacking of facies belts, explaining the broadly similar facies development and lithology of Cenomanian successions across northern Germany. The boundaries of the lithological units, however, tend to be considerably diachronous in a distal–proximal transect. In the late Middle and early Late Cenomanian, a final drowning and facies levelling (“oceanization”) is indicated by the widespread deposition of uniform calcareous nannofossil mudstones (Poor rhotomagense Limestones).},

Well preserved and abundant new fossils of birds and dinosaurs have provided unprecedented new evidence on the dinosaurian origin of birds, the arboreal origin of avian flight, and the origin of feathers prior to flapping flight. The Mesozoic avian assemblage mainly comprises two major lineages: the prevalent extinct group Enantiornithes, and the Ornithurae, which gave rise to all modern birds, as well as several more basal taxa. Cretaceous birds radiated into various paleoecological niches that included fish- and seed-eating. Significant size and morphological differences and variation in flight capabilities, ranging from gliding to powerful flight among early birds, highlight the diversification of birds in the Early Cretaceous. There is little evidence, however, to support a Mesozoic origin of modern avian groups. Controversy and debate, nevertheless, surround many of these findings, and more details are needed to give a better appreciation of the significance of these new discoveries.},

It is rich in volcanic composition and consists of upper and lower grey-black shale, basal sandy conglomerate, top tuffaceous sandstone, middle massive silty mudstone and siltstone, as well as andesite, with a thickness of 28-95 m. The Jianshangou Bed is famous all over the world for its bearing early birds, angiosperms and feathered dinosaurs, and it also yields bivalves, gastropods, conchostracans, ostracods, shrimps, insects, fish, amphibians, primitive mammals and other reptiles. These fossils are typical representatives of the Late Mesozoic Jehol Biota from eastern Asia. The Chaomidianzi and Sihetun formations, proposed in recent years, are regarded as the junior synonyms of the Jianshangou Bed. The Jehol Biota is endemic to eastern Asia, however, it has a large geographic distribution, more than half of the European territory. Many species of the biota have close relationships with the late Jurassic European counterparts, e.g. both Confuciusornis and Archaeopteryx are primitive birds, Sinosauropteryx has a similar skeleton construction with Compsognathus, the ostracode assemblage from the Jianshangou Bed is close to that from the Purbeck Bed in England, and Aeschnidium occurs in both the Jianshangou Bed and Solnhofen of Germany. Based on the biostratigraphic correlation, the Jianshangou Bed is more probably late Tithonian in age. The latest zircon U-Pb dating of the Jianshangou Bed gives 125.2 Ma, and is close to the feldspar Ar/Ar dating of 124.6 Ma. A glauconite dating of 125 Ma was once got from England near the J/K boundary within the Purbeck Bed, so it is still problematic to place the J/K boundary at 130, 135, 137, 142 or 145.5 Ma in the International Stratigraphic Charts.},

Based on recent geochronological and biostratigraphic studies of the fossil-bearing deposits, a preliminary temporal framework has been established and suggests that the Jehol Biota had lasted for at least 11 Ma during the late Early Cretaceous (131–120 Ma). The development of the Jehol Biota can be divided into three major phases, with the most significant biological radiations occurring in the second phase between the Barremian and Aptian (approximately 125 Ma). Thanks to a diverse forest environment, major vertebrate groups, i.e. pterosaurs, dinosaurs, birds and mammals, in the Jehol Biota are characterized by a remarkably high percentage of arboreal and herbivorous forms. In addition to strong phylogenetic and morphological differentiation and high taxonomic diversity, the Jehol Biota is also characterized by significant dietary differentiation and biological interactions, i.e. competition and co-evolution between various animal groups, in an environment shaped by tectonic activities and palaeoclimatic changes both at a global and local scale.

Here, after examining and analysing sediments and residual fossils from several key horizons, we postulate that the causal events were mainly phreatomagmatic eruptions. Pyroclastic density currents were probably responsible for the major causalities and for transporting the bulk of the terrestrial vertebrates from different habitats, such as lizards, birds, non-avian dinosaurs and mammals, into lacustrine environments for burial. Terrestrial vertebrate carcasses transported by and sealed within the pyroclastic flows were clearly preserved as exceptional fossils through this process.},

A taxonomic review of previously described sauropod specimens from eastern and south–eastern Asia reveals that a diversity of sauropods (including a titanosaurian, a basal titanosauriform and a ?euhelopodid, as well as several forms of indeterminate systematic position) was present in this region in the Early Cretaceous. This diversity conflicts with previous suggestions that eastern Asia was biogeographically isolated from the rest of Laurasia until the late Early Cretaceous and that the sauropod fauna was limited to the endemic East Asian clade Euhelopodidae. The presence of titanosauriform sauropods in the basal Cretaceous of Japan and Thailand indicate that the proposed faunal isolation of eastern Asia ended approximately 20 myr earlier than usually suggested.},

Currently, the Jehol Biota in a narrow sense (i.e., distribution limited to western Liaoning, northern Hebei, and southeastern Inner Mongolia) comprises a vertebrate assemblage of at least 121 genera and 142 species. Among them are 13 genera and 15 species of mammals, 33 genera and 39 species of birds, 30 genera and 35 species of dinosaurs, 17 genera and species of pterosaurs, 5 genera and species of squamates, 5 genera and 7 species of choristoderes, 2 genera and species of turtles, 8 genera and species of amphibians, 7 genera and 13 species of fishes as well as 1 genus and species of agnathan. All these known 121 genera are extinct forms, and only a small percentage of them (e.g., agnathans, some fishes and amphibians) can be referred to extant families. The Jehol vertebrate diversity already exceeds that of the contemporaneous lagerstätten such as Santana Fauna from Brazil and the Las Hoyas Fauna from Spain, and is nearly as great as that of the Jurassic Solnhofen Fauna and the Eocene Messel Fauna from Germany. Therefore, The Jehol Biota undoubtedly represents a world class lagerstätte in terms of both fossil preservation and vertebrate diversity. The success of the Jehol vertebrate diversity had a complex biological, geological, and paleoenvironmental background. Analysis of the habitat and diet of various vertebrate groups also indicates that the habitat and dietary differentiation had played a key role in the success of the taxonomic diversity of vertebrates of various ranks. Furthermore, the interactions among vertebrates, plants, and invertebrates as well as the competitions among various vertebrate groups and some key morphological innovations also contributed to the success of the Jehol vertebrate diversity.},

However, recent work has suggested that taxonomic diversity counts taken from the fossil record may be strongly biased by uneven spatiotemporal sampling. Although morphological diversity (disparity) is also frequently used to examine evolutionary radiations, no empirical work has yet addressed how disparity might be affected by uneven fossil record sampling. Here, we use pterosaurs (Mesozoic flying reptiles) as an exemplar group to address this problem. We calculate multiple disparity metrics based upon a comprehensive anatomical dataset including a novel phylogenetic correction for missing data, statistically compare these metrics to four geological sampling proxies, and use multiple regression modeling to assess the importance of uneven sampling and exceptional fossil deposits (Lagerstätten). We find that range-based disparity metrics are strongly affected by uneven fossil record sampling, and should therefore be interpreted cautiously. The robustness of variance-based metrics to sample size and geological sampling suggests that they can be more confidently interpreted as reflecting true biological signals. In addition, our results highlight the problem of high levels of missing data for disparity analyses, indicating a pressing need for more theoretical and empirical work.},

	abstract = {How much of evolutionary history is lost because of the unevenness of the fossil record? Lagerstätten, sites which have historically yielded exceptionally preserved fossils, provide remarkable, yet distorting insights into past life. When examining macroevolutionary trends in the fossil record, they can generate an uneven sampling signal for taxonomic diversity; by comparison, their effect on morphological variety (disparity) is poorly understood. We show here that lagerstätten impact the disparity of ichthyosaurs, Mesozoic marine reptiles, by preserving higher diversity and more complete specimens. Elsewhere in the fossil record, undersampled diversity and more fragmentary specimens produce spurious results. We identify a novel effect, that a taxon moves towards the centroid of a Generalized Euclidean dataset as its proportion of missing data increases. We term this effect ‘centroid slippage’, as a disparity-based analogue of phylogenetic stemward slippage. Our results suggest that uneven sampling presents issues for our view of disparity in the fossil record, but that this is also dependent on the methodology used, especially true with widely used Generalized Euclidean distances. Mitigation of missing cladistic data is possible by phylogenetic gap filling, and heterogeneous effects of lagerstätten on disparity may be accounted for by understanding the factors affecting their spatio-temporal distribution.},

	abstract = {Catastrophic hypotheses for mass extinctions are commonly criticized because many taxa gradually disappear from the fossil record prior to the extinction. Presumably, a geologically instantaneous catastrophe would not cause a reduction in diversity or a series of minor extinctions before the actual mass extinction. Two types of sampling effects, however, could cause taxa to appear to decline before their actual biotic extinction. The first of these is reduced sample size provided in the sedimentary record and the second, examined in greater detail, is artificial range truncation. The fossil record is discontinuous in time and the recorded ranges of species or of higher taxa can only extend to their last known occurrence in the fossil record. If the distribution of last occurrences is random with respect to actual biotic extinction, then apparent extinctions will begin well before a mass extinction and will gradually increase in frequency until the mass extinction event, thus giving the appearance of a gradual extinction. The recorded ranges of fossils, especially of uncommon taxa or taxa in habitats not represented by a continuous record, may be inadequate to test either gradual or catastrophic hypotheses. -from Authors},

	abstract = {The processes of geologic preservation are important for understanding the organisms represented by fossils. Some fossil differences are due to basic differences in organization of animals and plants, but the interpretation of fossils has also tended to be influenced by modes of preservation. Four modes of preservation generally can be distinguished: (1) Cellular permineralization (“petrifaction”) preserves anatomical detail, and, occasionally, even cytologic structures. (2) Coalified compression, best illustrated by structures from coal but characteristic of many plant fossils in shale, preserves anatomical details in distorted form and produces surface replicas (impressions) on enclosing matrix. (3) Authigenic preservation replicates surface form or outline (molds and casts) prior to distortion by compression and, depending on cementation and timing, may intergrade with fossils that have been subject to compression. (4) Duripartic (hard part) preservation is characteristic of fossil skeletal remains, predominantly animal. Molds, pseudomorphs, or casts may form as bulk replacements following dissolution of the original fossil material, usually by leaching. Classification of the kinds of preservation in fossils will aid in identifying the processes responsible for modifying the fossil remains of both animals and plants.},

	abstract = {The study of the Early Cretaceous terrestrial Jehol Biota, which provides a rare window for reconstruction of a Lower Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystem, is reviewed with a focus on some of the latest progress. A newly proposed definition of the biota based on paleoecology and taphonomy is accepted. Although the Jehol fossils are mainly preserved in two types of sedimentary rocks, there are various types of preservation with a complex mechanism that remains to be understood. New discoveries of significant taxa from the Jehol Biota, with an updated introduction of its diversity, confirm that the Jehol Biota represents one of the most diversified biotas of the Mesozoic. The evolutionary significance of major biological groups (e.g. dinosaurs, birds, mammals, pterosaurs, insects, and plants) is discussed mainly in the light of recent discoveries, and some of the most remarkable aspects of the biota are highlighted. The global and local geological, paleogeographic, and paleoenvironmental background of the Jehol Biota have contributed to the unique composition, evolution, and preservation of the biota, demonstrating widespread faunal exchanges between Asia and other continents caused by the presence of the Eurasia–North American continental mass and its link to South America, and confirming northeastern China as the origin and diversification center for a variety of Cretaceous biological groups. Although some progress has been made on the reconstruction of the paleotemperature at the time of the Jehol Biota, much more work is needed to confirm a possible link between the remarkable diversity of the biota and the cold intervals during the Early Cretaceous. Finally, future directions for the study of the Jehol Biota are proposed that highlight the great potential of more comprehensive and multidisciplinary studies to further our understanding of the biological and geological implications of the Jehol Lagerstätte.},

The structures in {STM}10-12 possess the histological and histochemical characteristics of smooth muscles fibers intertwined together with collagen fibers, resembling the contractile structure in the perifollicular membrane ({PFM}) of living birds. Fossilized blood vessels, very abundant in extant {PFMs}, are also preserved. Energy Dispersive Spectroscopy shows the preserved tissues primarily underwent alumino-silicification, with minor mineralization via iron oxides. No evidence of plant tissue was found.

Two leg skeletons from the same site also show an Archaeopteryxlevel of morphology, and provide the earliest indisputable evidence for a covering of body contour feathers. These specimens provide evidence for either an undiscovered pre-Archaeopteryx or a rapid, post-Archaeopteryxevolution in birds. As the first Jurassic birds to be described from outside Germany, they show that birds with long fingers terminating in large recurved claws were widely distributed. They are not found in the Early Cretaceous sediments of the same region, where there is a diverse assemblage of more advanced flying birds with smaller fingers and claws. The postcran-ial structure of Archaeopteryx {andConfuciusornis} seems to be adapted for climbing tree trunks and may have disappeared near the end of the Jurassic.},

	abstract = {In studies of the evolution of avian flight there has been a singular preoccupation with unravelling its origin. By contrast, the complex changes in morphology that occurred between the earliest form of avian flapping flight and the emergence of the flight capabilities of extant birds remain comparatively little explored. Any such work has been limited by a comparative paucity of fossils illuminating bird evolution near the origin of the clade of extant (i.e. ‘modern’) birds (Aves). Here we recognize three species from the Early Cretaceous of China as comprising a new lineage of basal ornithurine birds. Ornithurae is a clade that includes, approximately, comparatively close relatives of crown clade Aves (extant birds) and that crown clade. The morphology of the best-preserved specimen from this newly recognized Asian diversity, the holotype specimen of Yixianornis grabaui Zhou and Zhang 2001, complete with finely preserved wing and tail feather impressions, is used to illustrate the new insights offered by recognition of this lineage. Hypotheses of avian morphological evolution and specifically proposed patterns of change in different avian locomotor modules after the origin of flight are impacted by recognition of the new lineage. The complete articulated holotype specimen of Yixianornis grabaui, from the Early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning Province, in north-eastern China, arguably the best-preserved basal ornithurine specimen yet discovered, provides the earliest evidence consistent with the presence of extant avian tail feather fanning.},

The postcranial skeleton of this new triconodont shows a mosaic of characters, including a primitive pelvic girdle and hindlimb but a very derived pectoral girdle that is closely comparable to those of derived therians. Given the basal position of this taxon in mammalian phylogeny, its derived pectoral girdle indicates that homoplasies (similarities resulting from independent evolution among unrelated lineages) are as common in the postcranial skeleton as they are in the skull and dentition in the evolution of Mesozoic mammals.

Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that it is a basal therizinosaur (sister taxon to Therizinosauroidea) because it bears many basal therizinosaur characters in the dentition, pelvis and hind limbs. The new therizinosaur described here has unique tooth and jaw characters such as the offsetting of the tooth row by a shelf and dentary teeth with labially concave and lingually convex dentary teeth, similar to ornithopods and ceratopsians.},

Well preserved and abundant new fossils of birds and dinosaurs have provided unprecedented new evidence on the dinosaurian origin of birds, the arboreal origin of avian flight, and the origin of feathers prior to flapping flight. The Mesozoic avian assemblage mainly comprises two major lineages: the prevalent extinct group Enantiornithes, and the Ornithurae, which gave rise to all modern birds, as well as several more basal taxa. Cretaceous birds radiated into various paleoecological niches that included fish- and seed-eating. Significant size and morphological differences and variation in flight capabilities, ranging from gliding to powerful flight among early birds, highlight the diversification of birds in the Early Cretaceous. There is little evidence, however, to support a Mesozoic origin of modern avian groups. Controversy and debate, nevertheless, surround many of these findings, and more details are needed to give a better appreciation of the significance of these new discoveries.},

	abstract = {Early Cretaceous life and the environment were strongly influenced by the accelerated break up of Pangaea, which was associated with the formation of a multitude of rift basins, intensified spreading, and important volcanic activity on land and in the sea. These processes likely interacted with greenhouse conditions, and Early Cretaceous climate oscillated between “normal” greenhouse, predominantly arid conditions, and intensified greenhouse, predominantly humid conditions. Arid conditions were important during the latest Jurassic and early Berriasian, the late Barremian, and partly also during the late Aptian. Humid conditions were particularly intense and widespread during shorter episodes of environmental change ({EECs}): the Valanginian Weissert, the latest Hauterivian Faraoni, the latest Barremian–earliest Aptian Taxy, the early Aptian Selli, the early late Aptian Fallot and the late Aptian–early Albian Paquier episodes. Arid conditions were associated with evaporation, low biogeochemical weathering rates, low nutrient fluxes, and partly stratified oceans, leading to oxygen depletion and enhanced preservation of laminated, organic-rich mud ({LOM}). Humid conditions enabled elevated biogeochemical weathering rates and nutrient fluxes, important runoff and the buildup of freshwater lids in proximal basins, intensified oceanic and atmospheric circulation, widespread upwelling and phosphogenesis, important primary productivity and enhanced preservation of {LOM} in expanded oxygen-minimum zones. The transition of arid to humid climates may have been associated with the net transfer of water to the continent owing to the infill of dried-out groundwater reservoirs in internally drained inland basins. This resulted in shorter-term sea-level fall, which was followed by sea-level rise. These sea-level changes and the influx of freshwater into the ocean may have influenced oxygen-isotope signatures. Climate change preceding and during the Early Cretaceous {EECs} may have been rapid, but in general, the {EECs} had a “pre”-history, during which the stage was set for environmental change. Negative feedback on the climate through increased marine {LOM} preservation was unlikely, because of the low overall organic-carbon accumulation rates during these episodes. Life and climate co-evolved during the Early Cretaceous. Arid conditions may have affected continental life, such as across the Tithonian/Berriasian boundary. Humid conditions and the corresponding tendency to develop dys- to anaerobic conditions in deeper ocean waters led to phases of accelerated extinction in oceans, but may have led to more luxuriant vegetation cover on continents, such as during the Valanginian, to the benefit of herbivores. During Early Cretaceous {EECs}, reef systems and carbonate platforms in general were particularly vulnerable. They were the first to disappear and the last to recover, often only after several million years.},

	abstract = {Natural history collections are critical for modern scientific investigations, which are greatly expanding on the potential data applications of historic specimens. However, using these specimens outside their original intent introduces biases and potential misinterpretations. Anthropogenic biases can be introduced at any point during the life of museum specimens, from collection, preparation, and accession, to digitization. These biases can cause significant effects when the user is unaware of the collection context, as specific collection biases are often known anecdotally, but not ubiquitously. In this case study, the University of Kansas collection of Spence Shale Lagerstätte material was examined for anthropogenic biases using a collections inventory, interviews with stakeholders, and a literature review. Biases were found related to collector interest, locality preference, and researcher interest and specialization. These biases create a distorted view on the diversity and ecology of the Spence Shale, and need to be considered in future research.},

	title = {The Timetree of Life},
	isbn = {978-0-19-156015-6},
	abstract = {The evolutionary history of life includes two primary components: phylogeny and timescale. Phylogeny refers to the branching order (relationships) of species or other taxa within a group and is crucial for understanding the inheritance of traits and for erecting classifications. However, a timescale is equally important because it provides a way to compare phylogeny directly with the evolution of other organisms and with planetary history such as geology, climate, extraterrestrial impacts, and other features. The Timetree of Life is the first reference book to synthesize the wealth of information relating to the temporal component of phylogenetic trees. In the past, biologists have relied exclusively upon the fossil record to infer an evolutionary timescale. However, recent revolutionary advances in molecular biology have made it possible to not only estimate the relationships of many groups of organisms, but also to estimate their times of divergence with molecular clocks. The routine estimation and utilization of these so-called 'time-trees' could add exciting new dimensions to biology including enhanced opportunities to integrate large molecular data sets with fossil and biogeographic evidence (and thereby foster greater communication between molecular and traditional systematists). They could help estimate not only ancestral character states but also evolutionary rates in numerous categories of organismal phenotype; establish more reliable associations between causal historical processes and biological outcomes; develop a universally standardized scheme for biological classifications; and generally promote novel avenues of thought in many arenas of comparative evolutionary biology. This authoritative reference work brings together, for the first time, experts on all major groups of organisms to assemble a timetree of life. The result is a comprehensive resource on evolutionary history which will be an indispensable reference for scientists, educators, and students in the life sciences, earth sciences, and molecular biology. For each major group of organism, a representative is illustrated and a timetree of families and higher taxonomic groups is shown. Basic aspects of the evolutionary history of the group, the fossil record, and competing hypotheses of relationships are discussed. Details of the divergence times are presented for each node in the timetree, and primary literature references are included. The book is complemented by an online database (www.timetree.net) which allows researchers to both deposit and retrieve data.},

	abstract = {Amniotes, tetrapods that evolved the cleidoic egg and thus independence from aquatic larval stages, appeared ca 314 Ma during the Coal Age. The rapid diversification of amniotes and other tetrapods over the course of the Late Carboniferous period was recently attributed to the fragmentation of coal-swamp rainforests ca 307 Ma. However, the amniote fossil record during the Carboniferous is relatively sparse, with ca 33\% of the diversity represented by single specimens for each species. We describe here a new species of reptilian amniote that was collected from uppermost Carboniferous rocks of Prince Edward Island, Canada. Erpetonyx arsenaultorum gen. et sp. nov. is a new parareptile distinguished by 29 presacral vertebrae and autapomorphies of the carpus. Phylogenetic analyses of parareptiles reveal E. arsenaultorum as the closest relative of bolosaurids. Stratigraphic calibration of our results indicates that parareptiles began their evolutionary radiation before the close of the Carboniferous Period, and that the diversity of end-Carboniferous reptiles is 80\% greater than suggested by previous work. Latest Carboniferous reptiles were still half as diverse as synapsid amniotes, a disparity that may be attributable to preservational biases, to collecting biases, to the origin of herbivory in tetrapods or any combination of these factors.},

	abstract = {The Early Cretaceous is a critical interval in the early history of birds. Exceptional fossils indicate that important evolutionary novelties such as a pygostyle and a keeled sternum had already arisen in Early Cretaceous taxa, bridging much of the morphological gap between Archaeopteryx and crown birds. However, detailed features of basal bird evolution remain obscure because of both the small sample of fossil taxa previously considered and a lack of quantitative studies assessing rates of morphological evolution. Here we apply a recently available phylogenetic method and associated sensitivity tests to a large data matrix of morphological characters to quantify rates of morphological evolution in Early Cretaceous birds. Our results reveal that although rates were highly heterogeneous between different Early Cretaceous avian lineages, consistent patterns of significantly high or low rates were harder to pinpoint. Nevertheless, evidence for accelerated evolutionary rates is strongest at the point when Ornithuromorpha (the clade comprises all extant birds and descendants from their most recent common ancestors) split from Enantiornithes (a diverse clade that went extinct at the end-Cretaceous), consistent with the hypothesis that this key split opened up new niches and ultimately led to greater diversity for these two dominant clades of Mesozoic birds.},

In particular, I show how paleontologists are using various model-based techniques to correct the data. Drawing on this research, I argue for the following related theses: first, the ‘purity’ of a data model is not a measure of its epistemic reliability. Instead it is the fidelity of the data that matters. Second, the fidelity of a data model in capturing the signal of interest is a matter of degree. Third, the fidelity of a data model can be improved ‘vicariously’, such as through the use of post hoc model-based correction techniques. And, fourth, data models, like theoretical models, should be assessed as adequate (or inadequate) for particular purposes.},

	abstract = {Quantitative studies of fossil data have proven critical to a number of major macroevolutionary and macroecological discoveries, such as the ‘Big 5’ mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. The development and easy accessibility of major meta-data sources such as the Paleobiology Database and Geobiodiversity Database have also spurred the widespread application of these data to testing ecological hypotheses at finer spatiotemporal and phylogenetic scales. However, preservational, sampling, and taxonomic issues, along with analytical decisions, can impact the degree of interpretative resolution and obscure biological ‘signal’ from error/bias-introduced ‘noise’. The degree to which these factors can impact analytical interpretations is not well-documented in comparison to the scale of their application. Here, we review many forms of systematic bias that can creep into a paleoecological study, from the stage of data collection to the interpretation of analytical results. We provide two case studies where we artificially introduce such biases to previously-published datasets to illustrate their varying impacts on otherwise well-constrained data. The first case study focuses on the Cambrian Burgess Shale (konservat lagerstätte), and the second on bonebeds of the Cretaceous Belly River Group (konzentrat laggerstätte), with both representing highly-sampled, taphonomically-characterized, and spatiotemporally-constrained datasets developed through multiple years of sustained field collecting. In the former, we illustrate the impacts of collecting bias through quantitative comparisons of collected vs. discarded specimens over multiple field seasons and the impact of the loss of these data on ecological reconstructions and analysis. In the latter case study, we review the impact of preservational biases, differing approaches to their mitigation, and the impact of analytical decisions on ecological resolution. Lastly, we synthesize these case studies with our review of past approaches to propose a series of recommendations for future paleoecological and macroecological studies, emphasizing the continued importance of high-quality primary data and ongoing need for a first-principles approach to address existing issues of missing data.},

	shorttitle = {Romancing the Birds and Dinosaurs},
	abstract = {Birds and dinosaurs have dominated human interest for decades. In this well-supported revolutionary view of the field, critical questions are explored with credible evidence and biological thought. Are birds derived directly from advanced dinosaurs, or are they closely related dinosaur cousins? Did flight originate via the natural \&quot;gravity-assisted\&quot; trees-down model, or from the improbable “gravity-resisted” ground-up model? Were the earliest birds ground-predators or trunk-climbing gliders? Were dinosaurs hot-blooded with insulating protofeathers, or highly active, cold-blooded reptiles? These are among the questions addressed in this path-breaking book.Current consensus suggests that early birds were earth-bound and flight began on the ground. Reversing that logic, since birds are hot-blooded, by inference so too were dinosaurs, and extraordinarily complex feathers, flight brain and inner ear, evolved before flight in dinosaurs. The iconic early bird Archaeopteryx, despite innumerable flight and arboreal features, is now displayed as an earth-bound predator that could not fly. In reality, we have yet to provide satisfactory explanations for much of the biological origin and early evolution of birds. Among the questions addressed is whether truly feathered dinosaurs are in reality lost or \&quot;hidden birds?\&quot; The architectural complexity of feathers leads the author to the conclusion that if an animal has evolved extraordinarily complex, aerodynamically-designed feathers, an avian flight hand, flight membranes, and a flight brain, it\&\#39;s a bird.Birds and dinosaurs captivate and enchant the human imagination. These intriguing animals have dominated the field of paleontology and evolution for the past half century, engendering heated debate on avian ancestry, the origin of flight and feathers, and the biology of their fossils. Are birds living dinosaurs? In this series of entertainingly contentious and captivating essays evolutionary biologist Alan Feduccia writes with verve and humor to expose major problems in the field and advocate liberation from the shackles of consensus thinking about birds and dinosaurs. He maintains that the euphoria of paleontologists claiming to have solved the major problems of bird evolution is premature, largely generated by the adoption of a rigid, cult-like methodology, heavily blended with ideology, and excluding many biological and geological principles. He adroitly exposes and elucidates major mistakes in the field and their aftermath.Romancing the Birds and Dinosaurs is a lucid revelation of clarity and synthesis, a fascinating unveiling of the underlying science that has produced the good, but also often appalling fossil research and wild speculation in bird and dinosaur evolution. A must read for anyone interested in this rapidly evolving field, the short, concise and incisive essays provide the reader with access to this complex topic.{REVIEWS} and {WORDS} {OF} {PRAISEIn} this strikingly unconventional and brilliant book, Professor Alan Feduccia presents the current status of the recent controversy about the origin of birds with clarity and vigor. A thought-provoking personal exploration of what the bird fossils represent.---Sankar Chatterjee, Paul Whitfield Horn Distinguished Professor of Geosciences and Curator of Paleontology, Texas Tech University.Feduccia\&\#39;s book eloquently reminds us that consensus science is to be shied away from especially when it is used to plead special cases against basic scientific principles. The concept of “lost birds” is particularly intriguing as it defines what birds are and how special science obfuscates the simplicity of evolution.---David A. Burnham, Associate Researcher, University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute and Natural History Museum.Based on a thorough understanding of the empirical evidence, Feduccia presents a convincing account of avian origins from their putative ancestors.---Walter J. Bock, Professor of Evolutionary Biology, Columbia University and Research Associate, American Museum of Natural History.With candor, clear thinking, humor, and abundant evidence, Alan Feduccia’s Romancing the Birds and Dinosaurs should be mandatory reading for the countless millions who are intrigued by dinosaurs and their relatives, the birds. Feduccia points out the many empirical and logical shortcomings in the stubborn majority view that birds evolved from dinosaurs, an idea now solidly entrenched as dogma in education and popular culture. This new book will be as interesting to those who study human behavior and scientific methods as it will to students of vertebrate evolution.---David W.

	abstract = {Background Meta-analyses frequently include studies with small sample sizes. Researchers usually fail to account for sampling error in the reported within-study variances; they model the observed study-specific effect sizes with the within-study variances and treat these sample variances as if they were the true variances. However, this sampling error may be influential when sample sizes are small. This article illustrates that the sampling error may lead to substantial bias in meta-analysis results. Methods We conducted extensive simulation studies to assess the bias caused by sampling error. Meta-analyses with continuous and binary outcomes were simulated with various ranges of sample size and extents of heterogeneity. We evaluated the bias and the confidence interval coverage for five commonly-used effect sizes (i.e., the mean difference, standardized mean difference, odds ratio, risk ratio, and risk difference). Results Sampling error did not cause noticeable bias when the effect size was the mean difference, but the standardized mean difference, odds ratio, risk ratio, and risk difference suffered from this bias to different extents. The bias in the estimated overall odds ratio and risk ratio was noticeable even when each individual study had more than 50 samples under some settings. Also, Hedges’ g, which is a bias-corrected estimate of the standardized mean difference within studies, might lead to larger bias than Cohen’s d in meta-analysis results. Conclusions Cautions are needed to perform meta-analyses with small sample sizes. The reported within-study variances may not be simply treated as the true variances, and their sampling error should be fully considered in such meta-analyses.},

The site has been referred to as the ‘Chinese Pompeii’ because the dinosaurs and other animals were assumed to have been killed and buried by hot, airborne volcanic debris and ash in a single event; this has yet to be confirmed. Field and laboratory evidence for the sedimentological context of the fossils from the Lujiatun Unit is described in detail, and used to assess whether the fossil remains correspond to a single depositional event and whether this event was the direct result of volcanic activity. Fossils of the Lujiatun Unit occur in several horizons of volcaniclastic sediments that represent multiple depositional events. Petrological analysis shows that the fossil-bearing sediments were remobilised and deposited by water. The Lujiatun dinosaurs and other fossils were therefore not killed by a single airborne volcanic ash, but in multiple flood events with a high load of volcaniclastic debris.},

	abstract = {This study examined the effects of different sample sizes and different levels of bias (systematic error) between replicated measurements on the accuracy of estimates of random error calculated using two common formulae: Dahlberg's and the ‘method of moments’ estimator ({MME}). Computer-based numerical simulations were used to generate clinically realistic measurements involving random errors with a known distribution. For each simulation, two sets of ‘measured values’ were generated to provide the replicated data necessary for the estimation of the random error. Dahlberg's and the {MME} formula were applied to these paired data sets and the resulting estimates of error compared with the ‘true’ error. Nine different sample sizes (n = 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, and 100) and two different types of bias (additive and multiplicative) were examined for their effect on the estimated error. In each case, the estimates of the random error were based on the distribution of 5000 separate simulations.The results indicate that with a sample of less than 25–30 replicated measurements, the resulting estimates of error are potentially unreliable and may under or overestimate the true error, irrespective of the formula used in the calculation. Where, however, a bias exists between the replicate measurements, Dahlberg's formula can be expected to overestimate the true value of the random error even where the biases are small and difficult to detect by standard statistical tests. No such distorting effect was found for the {MME} formula, which provided estimates of error that were not meaningfully different from the true value even where relatively large biases existed between the replicates.These results suggest the following: 1. A sample of at least 25–30 cases should be replicated to provide an estimate of the random error. 2. Where the original study contains fewer than 20 cases, the estimate of error will be unreliable. In these circumstances, it would be helpful if a confidence interval for the true error was also quoted. 3. Unless one can be absolutely sure that no bias exists between the replicate measurements, Dahlberg's formula should be avoided and the {MME} formula used instead.},

Previous studies on the paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic background of the Jehol Biota have mainly focused on middle–late evolutionary stages while the less diverse and more narrowly distributed early Jehol Biota remains less understood. The Lower Cretaceous (Valanginian–Hauterivian) Dabeigou Formation in the Luanping Basin (North China), preserves the early stage of the Jehol Biota and can be subdivided into three members. To reconstruct the living environment of the early Jehol Biota, we explored the geochemistry, bulk mineralogy, total organic carbon, sedimentology, and paleoecology of the Dabeigou Formation from the Yushuxia section of the Luanping Basin. Decreased volcanic activity during the deposition of the Dabeigou Formation resulted in changes in its source material from felsic to mafic. The Luanping palaeolake reached its deepest water depth during deposition of the Member 2, and generally exhibited low salinity, while a short time of high salinity occurred during deposition of the Member 3. Analysis on the paleoweathering indices and other evidences, indicate that the Luanping area was generally in cold and humid climate conditions during deposition of the members 1 and 2 (correlated to the Weissert Event), but changed to warm climate conditions during deposition of the Member 3, which coincides with an increasing trend of biotic diversity. Consequently, our results suggest that the increasingly warm paleoclimate and lacustrine productivity, associated with decreasingly volcanic activity in North China, have contributed to the early evolution of the Jehol Biota.},

	abstract = {The “subjective Is” are those values and beliefs that a researcher or a practitioner brings to a research project or practice. The “subjective I” enables the researchers or practitioners to ask three sets of questions (a) “ who am I?”; (b) what factors influenced or informed the beliefs and values; and (c) how these beliefs and values affected my approach to developing a research interest, its research questions, theoretical approach, and methodologies. While these questions may not have an explicit influence on quantitative inquiries, it is the bedrock for a qualitative inquiry. Therefore, it is very important that qualitative researchers should engage in the process of identifying their “Subjective I’s” and reflect on how these could influence their preferred research interest, its research questions, theoretical approach and methodologies. This paper has three sections. First, I provided a description of reflexivity, highlighting its purpose in a qualitative research building on evidence from the literature. Subsequently, I provided the strengths of being reflexive as well as identify the potential limitations of not being reflexive in qualitative inquiry. Second, I identified and described three of my “subjective I” as inspired by Pushkin (1998). Third, I discussed how the identified three “subjective I” would influence some components of a hypothetical research topic including its theoretical approach, the research questions, and methodology approach.Keywords: Reflexivity, Qualitative Injury, Subjective I},

The model is intended to represent a warm—blooded vertebrate predator and its prey. The main conclusions are: (1) Coexistence of predator and prey is possible, but if so, the number of prey present will not be substantially below the equilibrium number in the absence of predators. Mutual regulation of predator and prey, with the latter substantially below the carrying capacity of the environment, is unstable. (2) Coexistence is more likely if there are differences in hunting ability between different individual predators–for example, between young and old predators. (3) Cover for the prey enables the prey species to survive the extinction of the predator, but does not make coexistence more likely.},

The models assume that the predator experiences density dependence via some mechanism other than prey depletion. The models also assume that the predator's functional response to each prey decreases as the density of the other prey species increases. This can occur either because of predator satiation or predator switching. The results suggest that positive indirect effects of one prey on the equilibrium density of others should occur frequently, especially when there is predator switching. Decreasing the mortality rate of one prey or adding a prey species may make it easier for additional prey species to invade the system and coexist. This occurs because the resulting decrease in the predator's functional response is greater than its positive numerical response. In many cases, different magnitudes of perturbation to one prey species will have opposite effects on the population density of the other prey species.},

	abstract = {The relative effects of shell destruction, transportation, and time‐averaging have been assessed in seventeen soft‐bottom, benthic fossil collections from the Pennsylvanian Wewoka Formation in Hughes County, Oklahoma. Invertebrates were identified to species level, and each was subject to a taphonomic evaluation to determine whether it was in place. Species that were not deemed parautochthonous (living at the location of collection shortly before final burial) were eliminated from the faunal lists to reduce the effects of time‐averaging and transportation in the fossil assemblages. Both reciprocal averaging and non‐metric multidimensional scaling ordinations revealed two biofacies. These were distinguished using both presence/absence data and numerical counts of species despite an overwhelming number of taxa occurring in both biofacies. Comparison between ordinations based on entire faunal lists with those based on parautochthonous faunal lists indicates that the two biofacies faithfully reproduce differences in the living distributions of member taxa but that the two biofacies underwent different degrees of time‐averaging and transportation. Time‐averaging leads to accumulation of taxa over time, thereby making presence/absence composition of collections more similar. Transportation, on the other hand, homogenizes originally patchy population distributions and makes relative abundances more uniform. Based on differences in abundances and presence/absence patterns, the stratigraphically lower biofacies underwent more transportation and more time‐averaging than the upper biofacies.

	abstract = {In even the most sophisticated taphonomic studies, processes involved in the formation of fossil assemblages can rarely be directly observed, and are inferred from measurements and censuses of skeletal material. Here, we present a numerical model designed to permit direct evaluation, either alone or in combination, of various postmortem effects on simulated fossil assemblages. The primary objective of the basic model is to provide a realistic framework for species distributions, through several generations of accumulation, on the sea floor. The model establishes two "communities," each containing 25 species and 10,000 individuals per generation, along an "environmental" gradient. Species are assigned randomly to one of five ecologic tiers, and relative abundances are determined using {MacArthur}'s random niche-boundary distribution. With respect to the gradient, geographic centers of abundance and ranges of distribution are also preassigned; they vary from species to species, within limits, to reflect the intergradational nature of the communities. Using these "guidelines," individuals belonging to each species are placed randomly or contagiously on a two-dimensional, 50 by 800 coordinate grid; the model is run through 50 generations to develop a time-averaged accumulation that can be sampled for numerical analyses. The power of the basic model is that it can be manipulated to simulate a variety of taphonomic processes, and the results can be compared directly to patterns that would have resulted without the taphonomic overprints. In this initial use, we analyze the effects of limited amounts of post-mortem transport on faunal distributional patterns. Comparisons of transported and untransported accumulations permit the testing of a procedure for detecting the amount of post-mortem skeletal transport along environmental gradients. To demonstrate its utility, this procedure is applied to a data set of subfossil molluscan remains from St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.},

However, the rimmed-shelf interpretation has been repeatedly challenged in favour of a ramp model with scattered corals. Based upon a re-analysis of selected localities in the Lessini Shelf, we here provide support for the barrier reef model based on four key observations: 1) systematic changes of coral growth-forms from branching in the proximal areas to massive at the platform margin; 2) a progressive increase of the hydrodynamic energy from the proximal belt towards the more distal environments in the Berici Hills; 3) the occurrence of shallow-water, euphotic conditions throughout the whole depositional system; and 4) the presence of restricted circulation in the proximal environments during sea-level lowstands, with lack of coral colonies. These features, together with the evidence of coral frameworks located on the southeastern edge of the Lessini Shelf, substantiate the occurrence of a reef-rimmed margin. The reefal rim acted as an efficient barrier, with the formation of a landward, wide lagoon protected from the action of waves and currents.},

	abstract = {Outcrops of Oligocene reef facies strata in the Vicentin area of northeastern Italy are well known because of the extensive collections of fossil reef corals that have been made from them. This paper presents an overview of the paleoecologic distribution of these reef corals and identifies coral communities indicative of different environments, or of different stages in ecologie successions.One of the largest and best exposed of outcropping Tertiary reefs is the Berici barrier-reef/lagoonal complex of the Castelgomberto Limestone in the Colli Berici and eastern Monte Lessini. The barrier-reef, which now forms much of the southeast face of the Colli Berici, has a core facies which is 150-200 meters thick ×800-900 meters wide and about 8 kilometers long. The lagoonal facies represents most of the Castelgomberto Limestone and extends northwestward back of the barrier-reef for about 30 kilometers. Other buildups of this area include a. patch-reefs and coppices in the shelf-lagoon, b. a basal Oligocene sequence alternating between thickets of branching corals in terrigenous beds and coral head biostromes in carbonates, c. coral carpets and biostromes high in the Castelgomberto Limestone which postdate the Berici Barrier-reef and d. biostromal assemblages adapted to soft mud substrates in marine tuffaceous mudstones which cap the Castelgomberto Limestone.In the Marósticano area, coral thickets, coppices and thin fringing-reefs formed along the northeastern margin of a large Oligocene volcanic complex. These structures developed in a region dominated by terrigenous clastic sedimentation in some cases adjacent to centers of submarine volcanic eruption.Variations of three basic coral assemblages are responsible for the wide spectrum of buildups: a. low diversity t4pioneer?? or thicket assemblage; b. high diversity reef-core and flank assemblage; and c. soft mud substrate assemblage. The environmental factors which appear to have been important in determining the areal mix of species, the community diversity and the abundance of the reef corals, are adaptation to water flow, potential to colonize unstable substrates and to survive sedimentation, and species-specific dominance relationships. Interaction of these factors can explain the {seraJ} succession of pioneer-to-intermediate-to-climax communities observed in many Tertiary reef buildups.Most of the biomass that existed at any given time when these ancient reefs were living left no trace in the fossil record of these buildups. Particularly important in the ecology of these reefs (by analogy with modern reefs) were the benthic algae, sponges and octocorals. For the most part, each of these groups (except coralline red algae) is unrepresented or greatly underrepresented in the Vicentin reef fossil record. This is because they lacked mineralized skeletal parts or because these skeletons were destroyed before they became part of the sediments during diagenesis. Most of the reef dwelling biota which did leave an extensive fossil record in the buildups actually aggregated a relatively minor part of the reef biovolume, either as standing crop or over a period of time.},

Non-geniculate coralline algae include six genera: Lithoporella melobesioides, Mesophyllum, Neogoniolithon, Spongites, Sporolithon, and Subterraniphyllum.

	abstract = {Changing components, rock textures, lithofacies, platform types and architecture throughout time are unique characteristics of carbonate rocks. Characterizing these attributes has been approached by 1) building reference models for specific Phanerozoic intervals, 2) recognizing the climatic impact in modulating carbonate production, and 3) analyzing the influence of changing bio-geochemical conditions. The reference-model approach is mostly based on biological evolution, the climatic-impact approach emphasizes temperature, and the bio-geochemical approach considers the changes in Mg/Ca ratios and Ca++ concentrations in the oceans. To date, however, an analysis integrating all of these factors is still missing. The analysis presented here includes all these factors but also {CO}2, which is fundamental for both photosynthesis and {CaCO}3 precipitation. Here we analyze the waxing and waning of Cenozoic reef limestones from the central Tethys region through several steps: 1) on the basis of rock volume, rock textures, associated sediments and light-dependent skeletal components, as records of light penetration and wave energy (depth); 2) on global environmental conditions (δ13C, δ18O, {pCO}2, temperature); and 3) on the basis of functionality, nutritional requirements and available resources. Through the Cenozoic, water motion, whether induced by surface or internal waves or by currents, increased as the thermal gradients strengthened, both with depth and with latitude. Active water motion is essential for plankton catchers such as corals, but less so for many larger benthic foraminifers ({LBF}). Pycnoclines in the meso-oligophotic zone would then favor the benthic plankton catchers such as corals, but would be detrimental for many {LBF}. Warm temperatures favored {LBF}. The Eocene {LBF} families predominated during lowering of atmospheric {pCO}2 by using respiratory {CO}2 to enhance the symbiont production of photosynthates under oligotrophic conditions and limited turbulence, whereas the Miocene families had to adapt to a progressive increase in turbulence. The eurythermal coralline red algae, however, became preponderant producers in the mesophotic zone during times when the δ13C was relatively high. This explains two apparent paradoxes: 1) corals thrive best when the Earth's high latitudes cool, and 2) the dominance of corals and {LBF} is inversely correlated, despite they both require tropical conditions and have similar trophic strategies (mixotrophy).},

	abstract = {The Castelgomberto Limestone is a 200 m thick unit of Early Oligocene age (Rupelian) outcropping in the eastern Lessini Mountains (Southern Alps of Northern Italy). The internal cyclic organization of this Oligocene unit is described and analyzed on the basis of four selected sections; about 13 well-bedded grainstone units alternate with marly horizons rich in corals. This peculiar cyclicity is here interpreted as a response to variations in platform hydrodynamics, i.e. to smaller eustatic fluctuations affecting the Lessini Shelf reef-lagoonal complex. During highstand periods, the shelf was open and relatively deep (20-50m), and tidal currents and periodic storms were able to distribute bioclastic sands. During lowstands the shelf was more protected by the occurrence of marginal reefs and was colonized by patches of poritid corals, mainly branching. Moreover, the largely exposed northern areas supplied fine detritus to the shelf itself.},

Preliminary examination of the stratigraphic and geographic distribution of Actinacis species suggests that: 1) the Tertiary distribution of the genus ranges from the Late Paleocene to the Late Oligocene; 2) the highest species diversity occrred during the Middle Eocene, when the genus consisted of a relatively large number of geographically restricted species; 3) only two widespread species survived the Eocene/Oligocene turnover and reached the Late Oligocene, when the genus became globally extinct.},

	abstract = {Quantification of the isotope altitude effect from precipitation allows the identification of recharge altitudes in high-relief areas. However, steep terrains frequently limit the use of this precipitation-based approach. Perennial rivers often provide easy, year-round access for water sampling. However, in high-relief regions rivers may not adequately represent regional precipitation isotope patterns because they integrate isotope signals along their course. This prevents the calculation of an altitudinal isotope gradient from river water samples alone. We present a study that shows how a river-based sampling approach served to determine the altitude effect. Replacing the original sample site altitude with the mean upstream catchment elevation as calculated from a digital elevation model allowed us to establish a plausible altitude isotope effect from stream water. The correction approach was verified independently using precipitation isotope data. This approach can potentially be transferred to other regions where precipitation sampling at various elevations is difficult to determine.},

In this time period, 6 separate flasks were sampled for oxygen concentration and their stable isotope ratios (O-18/O-16) in dissolved and headspace phases. The oxygen isotope composition of the water was also analysed as an input for the transfer of its O-18/O-16 ratio to molecular oxygen via production by algae. This photosynthetic transfer of the isotope composition of water was counterbalanced by oxygen consumption that enriched both phases in O-18. For this reason, neither dissolved oxygen nor oxygen in the headspace reached the O-18-depleted oxygen isotope ratio of H2O despite excessive photosynthesis. Oxygen that was produced by photosynthesis accumulated with a yield of 13.96 mmol L-1 in the headspace and with 0.5 mmol L-1 in the fluid phase. This difference was due to rapid degassing of the solution. It was further amplified by preferential consumption of the dissolved O-2 phase. In order to quantify oxygen production and its consumption we determined photosynthesis/respiration (P/R) ratios with a formula that combined O-2 concentrations and its isotope ratios. It revealed a P/R ratio of 7.7 after 11 days. After this it decreased again and moved towards dominance of respiration. With this work our results introduce a new method to monitor the growth and efficiency of algae in controlled experiments.},

	doi = {10.1002/eco.2521},
	abstract = {The current research of carbon cycling in inland waters lacks a sound knowledge of carbon outgassing from small streams. As a consequence, these compartments of the terrestrial water cycle might still be seriously underrepresented in estimates of global carbon transfer budgets from land surfaces. This study investigated carbon sources and sinks of a mountain river in a silicate catchment. For this purpose, the high-relief Gravona river, in the western part of the island of Corsica (France) in the Western Mediterranean, was investigated for field parameters, dissolved inorganic carbon ({DIC}) and its stable carbon isotopes (δ$^{\textrm{13}}${CDIC}). The source region was characterized by low {DIC} contents and high δ$^{\textrm{13}}${CDIC} values that decreased further downstream due to increasing soil respiration. Associated increasing {DIC} concentrations and elevated seasonality in the lower river section also indicated more respiration and subsequent {DIC}-input by weathering. The aqueous partial pressure ({pCO}2(aq)) was lowest at the source of the Gravona river and samples from the cold season even showed undersaturation that led to uptake of atmospheric {CO}2. Further downstream, the seasonality of {pCO}2(aq) increased and was particularly pronounced near the river mouth where {CO}2 degassing took place. Average {DIC} flux along the river was 0.129 Gg C year$^{\textrm{−1}}$ and was almost equal to {CO}2 degassing from the river surface with 0.128 Gg C year$^{\textrm{−1}}$. Our study showed that on an annual basis the river is an overall weak to medium source of {CO}2 to the atmosphere even though headwater parts of the river seasonally act as {CO}2 sinks.},

	abstract = {Coastal freshwater aquifers are under threat and in many cases gradually decline due to climate change and over-extraction of water with the rapidly expanding human activities including agriculture and tourism. In this study, coastal sedimentary aquifer systems in northern Sri Lanka were characterized by integrated approaches such as mass balance calculations, Seawater Mixing Index ({SMI}) and Water Quality Index ({WQI}). A total of 34 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for field parameters ({pH}, electrical conductivity ({EC}), dissolved oxygen and temperature) their major ions (Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$, Mg$^{\textrm{2+}}$, Na$^{\textrm{+}}$, K$^{\textrm{+}}$, Cl$^{\textrm{-}}$, {SO}4$^{\textrm{2−}}$, {NO}3$^{\textrm{−}}$, {HCO}3$^{\textrm{−}}$) and selected trace elements (Sr, Ba, B) as well as stable water isotopes (δ$^{\textrm{18}}${OH}2O and δ$^{\textrm{2}}${HH}2O). The {EC} in investigated groundwater samples ranged from 81 to 5690 μS/cm (mean - 1260 μS/cm) and served as the first indication of seawater intrusion. The study region consists of predominantly Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$-{HCO}3$^{\textrm{−}}$ and Na$^{\textrm{+}}$-Cl$^{\textrm{-}}$ water types indicating freshening and seawater intrusions as revealed by a Hydrogeochemical Facies Evaluation ({HFE}) diagram. The {WQI} and {SMI} approach indicated that in the study region, 50–58\% of samples are affected by seawater intrusion. Up to 28\% of seawater admixture was noted based on the mass balance calculation using Cl$^{\textrm{-}}$ (0.55–156 meq/L) as a conservative tracer. This result significantly correlates with the calculated {WQI} (r = +0.944; p {\textless} 0.000). Water isotope values indicated that most of the groundwater in the area is recharged directly from precipitation while some samples showed influences of evaporation and also mixing with seawater. In summary, the investigated coastal sedimentary aquifer system in the northern part of Sri Lanka is already severely affected by seawater intrusion. However, as marked by the dissolution of carbonate minerals under the influence of monsoonal rains leads to the freshening of groundwater. This study showed that {WQI} combined with mass balance calculations is useful in assessing the vulnerability of coastal aquifers in arid and semi-arid regions.},

The {PCA} identified fewer variabilities for major ions in reservoirs than in lakes. Moreover, our analyses showed that lakes generally have more total dissolved solids ({TDS}). Such higher {TDS} loads in lakes could result from more diverse (and less controlled) inputs from larger catchments and from longer lasting interactions with thicker internal sediment layers. Global median geochemical compositions identified both reservoirs and lakes as calcium-bicarbonate-type waters. This first synthesis provides a basis for future studies and may serve as the start of a global database on these important water bodies.},

With ongoing climate change the relationship between water vapour sources and sinks is under constant evolution and plays an important role for water budget assessments. This study analysed monthly integrated and event-based precipitation samples from two field sites in the Western Pamir Mountains (Tajikistan) for stable isotope compositions of oxygen (O-18) and hydrogen (H-2) of water. The aim was to investigate water vapour sources and, in particular, to evaluate contributions of water vapour from the Mediterranean region. The latter has been often postulated as a potential moisture source region for Central Asia. Deuterium excess values (d), that serve as a fingerprint of moisture origin, were below 13 parts per thousand in monthly integrated samples, for most of the year. This indicates a smaller contribution of high Mediterranean moisture (approximate to 20 parts per thousand) to the Western Pamir Mountains than originally expected. A maximum d value of 19 parts per thousand was observed in March, which is not in agreement with the common observation of increased Mediterranean contribution during winter ({DJF}). A Lagrangian backward trajectory model ({HYSPLIT}) was applied to infer the general air mass origin for sampled precipitation events. A maximum contribution of western' moisture of 40\% was also detected in March, while 40\%-60\% of moisture that contributed to precipitation events in winter was transported by trajectories that originated from the Northern Indian Ocean.},

	abstract = {Next to water quality deterioration, cyanobacteria blooms can affect turnover of aqueous carbon, including dissolved inorganic carbon ({DIC}), dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}), and particulate organic carbon ({POC}). We investigated interactions of these three phases and their stable isotopes in a freshwater pond with periodic cyanobacterial blooms over a period of 23 months. This helped to map turnover and sources of aqueous carbon before, during, and after bloom events. During bloom events {POC} isotope values (δ$^{\textrm{13}}${CPOC}) increased up to −17.4‰, after aqueous {CO}2 ({CO}2(aq)) fell below an atmospheric equilibration value of 412 μatm. Additionally, carbon isotope enrichment between {CO}2(aq) and {POC} (ε{CO}2-phyto) ranged from 2.0 to 21.5‰ with lowest fractionations observed at {pH} values above 8.9. The increase of δ$^{\textrm{13}}${CPOC} and decrease of ε{CO}2-phyto values at low {pCO}2 and high {pH} was most likely caused by the activation of the carbon concentrating mechanism ({CCM}). This mechanism correlated with prevalent assimilation of $^{\textrm{13}}$C-enriched {HCO}3$^{\textrm{−}}$. Surprisingly, {CO}2(aq) still contributed more than 50\% to the {POC} pool down to {pCO}2 values of around 150 μatm. Only after this threshold the reduced ε{CO}2-phyto suggested incorporation of $^{\textrm{13}}$C-enriched {HCO}3$^{\textrm{−}}$.},

	volume = {35},
	doi = {10.1002/rcm.9024},
	abstract = {Rationale: Investigations of the isotope ratios of dissolved oxygen (δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{DO}{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) provide valuable information about the oxygen cycle in aquatic systems. However, oxidation of Fe({II}) may change pristine δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{DO}{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} values during storage and can lead to a misinterpretation. We sampled an Fe({II})-rich spring system and measured δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{DO}{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} values at various time intervals in order to determine influences of Fe-oxidation. Methods: Water samples were collected from an Fe-rich spring and related stream and the δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{DO}{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} values were measured in fresh, 4- and 13-day-old samples with an isotope ratio mass spectrometer. Three replicates were measured for each sample with a 1σ of ± 0.2‰. On-site parameters and Fe({II}) contents were also measured over the course of the spring system by multi-parameter probes and spectrophotometry. Results: The δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{DO}{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} values over the course of the spring system in fresh, 4- and 13-day-old samples revealed differences of up to 8‰. We explain this increase by the consumption of {DO} by Fe({II})-oxidation. After a flow length of 85 m the differences in δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{DO}{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} values between fresh and older samples decreased because most of the Fe({II}) was consumed. Conclusions: False interpretations of δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{DO}{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} values are possible if Fe-rich water samples are measured after too long storage, and we recommend measurement immediately after sampling.},

Fish from natural environments proved to have better sensory properties in terms of fruity, sweet, and citrusy attributes, compared to farmed fish. However, the farmed fish were found to have higher nutritional value based on their lipid contents. These differences might relate to the introduction of feed extrudates, which could influence the overall quality of fish products. Thereby, malodor episodes linked to musty/earthy off-odor notes related to odorants including geosmin, beta-caryophyllene, (E,Z)-2,4-nonadienal, and (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal. These compounds, in turn, correlated with Asticcacaulis benevestitus, Curvibacter sp., Albidiferax sp., Aquabacterium commune, and Aquabacterium citratiphilum abundance and were further affected by oxygen levels in the water column.},

It considers the health of humans, animals, and the ecosystem as a whole, where health issues cannot be tackled in isolation. The geogenic environment that is represented by the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere is an important component and has direct links with noncommunicable chronic health issues among humans and animals. For instance, excess or lack of particular elements, such as fluoride in the geogenic environment, plays an important role in health as exemplified by dental and skeletal fluorosis. Other examples include the consumption of arsenic-contaminated water that can lead to cancer and high background radiation caused by uranium and radon. In this chapter, we provide an overview and highlight the importance of the geochemistry of the living environment and its contribution to the "One Health" concept.},

	abstract = {Dissolved oxygen ({DO}) is crucial for aerobic life in streams and rivers and mostly depends on photosynthesis (P), ecosystem respiration (R) and atmospheric gas exchange (G). However, climate and land use changes progressively disrupt metabolic balances in natural streams as sensitive reflectors of their catchments. Comprehensive methods for mapping fundamental ecosystem services become increasingly important in a rapidly changing environment. In this work we tested {DO} and its stable isotope (O-18/O-16) ratios as novel tools for the status of stream ecosystems. For this purpose, six diel sampling campaigns were performed at three low-order and mid-latitude European streams with different land use patterns. Modelling of diel {DO} and its stable isotopes combined with land use analyses showed lowest P rates at forested sites, with a minimum of 17.9 mg m(-2) h(-1). Due to high R rates between 230 and 341 mg m(-2) h(-1) five out of six study sites showed a general heterotrophic state with P:R:G ratios between 0.1:1.1:1 and 1:1.9:1. Only one site with agricultural and urban influences showed a high P rate of 417 mg m(-2) h(-1) with a P:R:G ratio of 1.9:1.5:1. Between all sites gross G rates varied between 148 and 298 mg m(-2) h(-1). In general, metabolic rates depend on the distance of sampling locations to river sources, light availability, nutrient concentrations and possible exchanges with groundwater. The presented modelling approach introduces a new and powerful tool to study effects of land use on stream health. Such approaches should be integrated into future ecological monitoring.},

	doi = {10.1038/s41598-020-69912-0},
	abstract = {Sources of particulate organic carbon ({POC}) play important roles in aqueous carbon cycling because internal production can provide labile material that can easily be turned into {CO}2. On the other hand, more recalcitrant external {POC} inputs can cause increased loads to sedimentary organic matter that may ultimately cause {CH}4 release. In order to differentiate sources, stable isotopes offer a useful tool. We present a study on the Itupararanga Reservoir (Brazil) where origins of {POC} were explored by comparing its isotope ratios (δ$^{\textrm{13}}${CPOC}) to those of dissolved inorganic carbon (δ$^{\textrm{13}}${CDIC}). The δ$^{\textrm{13}}${CPOC} averaged around − 25.1‰ in near-surface waters, which indicates higher primary production inferred from a fractionation model that takes into account carbon transfer with a combined evaluation of δ$^{\textrm{13}}${CPOC}, δ$^{\textrm{13}}${CDIC} and aqueous {CO}2. However, δ$^{\textrm{13}}${CPOC} values for water depths from 3 to 15 m decreased to − 35.6‰ and indicated different carbon sources. Accordingly, the δ$^{\textrm{13}}${CDIC} values of the reservoir averaged around + 0.6‰ in the top 3 m of the water column. This indicates {CO}2 degassing and photosynthesis. Below this depth, {DIC} isotope values of as low as − 10.1‰ showed stronger influences of respiration. A fractionation model with both isotope parameters revealed that 24\% of the {POC} in the reservoir originated from detritus outside the reservoir and 76\% of it was produced internally by aqueous {CO}2 fixation.},

	abstract = {Introduction: Although the investigation of chronic kidney disease of uncertain etiology ({CKDu}) has identified many possible influencing factors in recent years, the exact pathomechanism of this disease remains unclear. Methods: In this study, we collected 13 renal biopsies from patients with symptomatic {CKDu} (Sym-{CKDu}) from Sri Lanka with well-documented clinical and socioeconomic factors. We performed light microscopy and electron microscopic evaluation for ultrastructural analysis, which was compared with 100 biopsies from German patients with 20 different kidney diseases. Results: Of the 13 Sri Lankan patients, 12 were men (92.3\%), frequently employed in agriculture (50\%), and experienced symptoms such as feeling feverish (83.3\%), dysuria (83.3\%), and arthralgia (66.6\%). Light microscopic evaluation using activity and chronicity score revealed that cases represented early stages of {CKDu} except for 2 biopsies, which showed additional signs of diabetes. Most glomeruli showed only mild changes, such as podocyte foot process effacement on electron microscopy. We found a spectrum of early tubulointerstitial changes including partial loss of brush border in proximal tubules, detachment of tubular cells, enlarged vacuoles, and mitochondrial swelling associated with loss of cristae and dysmorphic lysosomes with electron-dense aggregates. None of these changes occurred exclusively in Sym-{CKDu}; however, they were significantly more frequent in these cases than in the control cohort. Conclusion: In conclusion, our findings confirm the predominant and early alterations of tubular structure in {CKDu} that can occur without significant glomerular changes. The ultrastructural changes do not provide concrete evidence of the cause of {CKDu} but were significantly more frequent in Sym-{CKDu} than in the controls.},

	abstract = {Fluoride is a beneficial trace element for human health as its deficiency and excess levels can cause detrimental health effects. In Sri Lanka, dry zone regions can have excessive levels of fluoride in drinking water and can cause dental and skeletal fluorosis. In addition to drinking water, traditional habits of tea consumption can cause an additional intake of fluoride in the population. A total number of 39 locally blended black tea samples were collected from a village where chronic kidney disease with undetermined origin ({CKDu}) is prevalent. In addition, unblended tea samples were obtained from tea-producing factories. The fluoride contents in infusions of 2\% weight per volume (w/v) were measured using calibrated ion-selective fluoride electrodes. The mean fluoride content was 2.68±1.03 mg/L in loose tea, 1.87±0.57mg/L in packed tea samples, and 1.14±0.55 mg/L in unblended tea. Repeated brewing of the same tea leaves showed that over 50\% of fluoride leached into the solution in the first infusion. An estimate of the daily total average fluoride intake via tea consumption per person is 2.68 mg per day. With groundwater in many dry zone regions in Sri Lanka showing high fluoride levels that exceed 0.5 mg/L, the additional daily intake can rapidly exceed recommended thresholds of 2 mg/day. This can add to adverse health impacts that might also relate to {CKDu}.},

	abstract = {Rivers are significant sources of {CO}2 to the atmosphere, and karstic watersheds are particularly important in this respect due to their large availability of inorganic carbon. This study examines characteristics of dissolved inorganic carbon ({DIC}) and excess partial pressures of {CO}2 ({epCO}2) in the source springs and headwaters of four watersheds in a Central European karstic region, via dissolved inorganic carbon concentration and stable carbon isotope measurements. Our results show the most $^{\textrm{13}}$C-depleted δ$^{\textrm{13}}${CDIC} values at the source springs, which become rapidly enriched downstream due to {CO}2 degassing. Concurrently, {epCO}2 values, while consistently in excess of atmospheric concentrations at the spring sources, show decreases of up to 92\% within only 50 m downstream distance. In conjunction with the large observed flux estimates of up to 88 g C m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ day$^{\textrm{−1}}$, these findings suggest that karstic springs are major {CO}2 sources to the atmosphere. Because headwater streams constitute the bulk of the surface area of most watersheds, they may provide a disproportionately large contribution to {CO}2 effluxes in carbonate-dominated basins, in which source springs play a particularly important role.},

The Mediterranean region is one of the hotspots of future climate change; therefore, data on the water cycle are urgently needed. We measured oxygen isotope compositions in creek water, precipitation, stem water, needle water, and tree-ring cellulose over one growing season to establish the relationship between isotope compositions in different compartments along a fractionation pathway. We analyzed plant material from pine trees (Pinus nigra J.F. Arn subsp. laricio (Poiret) Maire var. Corsicana Hyl. and Pinus pinaster Aiton) at five locations along an elevation gradient from sea level to 1600 m asl. We traced back the oxygen isotope composition from source to sink in tree-ring cellulose in order to identify the water sources used by the trees, and to quantify the extent of isotope fractionation processes. Our results showed that the trees used different water sources over the course of the growing season, ranging from winter snow meltwater to summer precipitation at higher sites and deep soil water reservoirs at coastal sites. Needle water enrichment was higher at higher elevation sites than at coastal locations, highlighting the importance of site-specific climate conditions on the isotopic composition values in tree material. Water availability seems to be most restricted at the highest site, making these trees most vulnerable to climate change.},

A potential, but not very widespread source of water is the presence of near-ground clouds, mostly fog. In this study, we investigate foglow stratus ({FLS}) frequencies in Corsica, derived from a data set of Meteosat Second Generation {SEVIRI}, whereby a distinction between fog and low stratus is hardly feasible using remote sensing data. The {FLS} frequency was studied with respect to its interaction with distinct locally-generated wind and its dependence on the planetary boundary layer height ({PBLH}) obtained by {ERA}5 reanalysis (the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, {ECMWF}). Results show that radiation {FLS} is formed in coastal areas at sunrise, with low {PBLH}. On the other hand, in the interior of the island at sunset, a maximum of advection {FLS} is formed, fostered by locally-generated and related transport of moisture. On the east side of the island, {FLS} frequency is lower throughout the year due to frequent lee situations. This situation is reinforced by reduced synoptic moisture transport by westerly winds, so that westerly exposed slopes benefit from moisture input by {FLS} formation.},

	abstract = {Sinkholes play a critical role in groundwater systems by facilitating both recharge and discharge of groundwater, serving as indicators of underlying geologic processes, shaping subsurface hydrology, and influencing water quality. Therefore, studying karst groundwater systems is essential for effective groundwater management, especially in areas with limestone sequences. Spatial variations of water isotopes (δ$^{\textrm{2}}$H, δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O), dissolved inorganic and organic carbon ({DIC} and {DOC}), including their isotopes alone with {pH}, {EC}, alkalinity and chloride were determined in surface- and groundwater of the Mulankavil karst aquifer basin in the northwest of Sri Lanka. Twenty-seven groundwater wells, one offshore spring and two sinkholes were selected for sampling. The contribution of sinkhole water and seawater to karst aquifers was calculated using δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O and chloride as tracers. In addition, deuterium excess (d-excess) values were used to determine groundwater evaporative loss before infiltration. Near the Mulankavil sinkhole area, the mixing of surface water and infiltrating rainwater was found to vary between 26 and 60\%, with an average of 56\%. In contrast, surface water mixing in the Nagapadduvan and Vellankulam sinkholes was about 41–59\% and 33–70\%, respectively. In near coastal wells, these values fell to 20\% due to the influence of seawater intrusion. During the dry season, groundwater d-excess varied between −5.0 and + 10.8‰, while surface water in sinkholes showed values between +1.8 and −9.4‰. Groundwater wells near the Mulankavil sinkhole showed lower {DIC} ({\textless}5.5 mmol/L) with enriched δ$^{\textrm{13}}${CDIC} ({\textgreater}-14‰). The karst aquifer systems in northern Sri Lanka exhibit two main recharge mechanisms: (a) selective recharge by surface water at sinkholes and (b) diffuse recharge by direct rainfall over the study area. Seawater intrusion near the coast can be prevented by artificially recharging rainwater during the monsoon season.},

	abstract = {Quality of drinking water has become a significant concern with chronic kidney disease of uncertain aetiology ({CKDu}), particularly in the dry zone regions of Sri Lanka. In this study, groundwaters consumed by biopsy-proven {CKDu} patients were assessed for identifying possible hydrogeochemical risk factors because histopathological observations are still considered the best method for identifying {CKDu} cases. Major anions, cations, and 22 trace elements in groundwater were measured in addition to dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) and its isotope ratios (expressed as δ$^{\textrm{13}}$C{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{DOC}{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}). Variations of groundwater quality were monitored monthly in five selected wells. The data were compared with a non-endemic region with a similar climatic and socio-economic background. Groundwater used by {CKDu} cases is predominantly of the Ca–Mg–{HCO}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} type. Over 88\% of the samples showed excess hardness, while 44\% showed high fluoride (F$^{\textrm{−}}$) contents ({\textgreater} 0.60 mg/L). These two parameters are noticeably different compared to groundwater from non-endemic regions with similar geoenvironmental backgrounds. The dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) content varied from 0.06 to 0.30 mmol/L with a mean value of 0.15 mmol/L in {CKDu} wells. In most cases, known nephrotoxic trace elements such as As, Pb, Cd, and U were found to be lower than 0.01 µg/L. Seasonally, F$^{\textrm{−}}$ and Si$^{\textrm{4+}}$ (as H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}{SiO}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) content fluctuated, even though monsoon rain inputs did not seem to alter the geochemical composition. Principal component analysis ({PCA}) indicated that the dissolution of aquifer minerals and ion exchange processes are most likely responsible for the groundwater geochemistry in the study terrain. This study highlights the importance of F$^{\textrm{−}}$, hardness (Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ + Mg$^{\textrm{2+}}$), and Si$^{\textrm{4+}}$ in groundwaters of {CKDu}-related tropical terrains. The synergetic impact of these parameters needs further systematic studies, ideally combined with animal models, to unravel the aetiological mechanisms of {CKDu}.},

	abstract = {The relevance of {CO}2 emissions from geological sources to the atmospheric carbon budget is becoming increasingly recognized. Although geogenic gas migration along faults and in volcanic zones is generally well studied, short-term dynamics of diffusive geogenic {CO}2 emissions are mostly unknown. While geogenic {CO}2 is considered a challenging threat for underground mining operations, mines provide an extraordinary opportunity to observe geogenic degassing and dynamics close to its source. Stable carbon isotope monitoring of {CO}2 allows partitioning geogenic from anthropogenic contributions. High temporal-resolution enables the recognition of temporal and interdependent dynamics, easily missed by discrete sampling. Here, data is presented from an active underground salt mine in central Germany, collected on-site utilizing a field-deployed laser isotope spectrometer. Throughout the 34-day measurement period, total {CO}2 concentrations varied between 805 {ppmV} (5th percentile) and 1370 {ppmV} (95th percentile). With a 400-ppm atmospheric background concentration, an isotope mixing model allows the separation of geogenic (16–27\%) from highly dynamic anthropogenic combustion-related contributions (21–54\%). The geogenic fraction is inversely correlated to established {CO}2 concentrations that were driven by anthropogenic {CO}2 emissions within the mine. The described approach is applicable to other environments, including different types of underground mines, natural caves, and soils.},

	abstract = {A large portion of terrestrially derived carbon outgasses as carbon dioxide ({CO}2) from streams and rivers to the atmosphere. Particularly, the amount of {CO}2 outgassing from small headwater streams is highly uncertain. Conservative estimates suggest that they contribute 36 \% (i.e. 0.93 petagrams (Pg) C yr−1) of total {CO}2 outgassing from all fluvial ecosystems on the globe. In this study, stream \textit{p}{CO}2, dissolved inorganic carbon ({DIC}), and \textit{δ}13CDIC data were used to determine {CO}2 outgassing from an acidic headwater stream in the Uhlířská catchment (Czech Republic). This stream drains a catchment with silicate bedrock. The applied stable isotope model is based on the principle that the 13C ∕ 12C ratio of its sources and the intensity of {CO}2 outgassing control the isotope ratio of {DIC} in stream water. It avoids the use of the gas transfer velocity parameter (\textit{k}), which is highly variable and mostly difficult to constrain. Model results indicate that {CO}2 outgassing contributed more than 80 \% to the annual stream inorganic carbon loss in the Uhlířská catchment. This translated to a {CO}2 outgassing rate from the stream of 34.9 kg C m−2 yr−1 when normalised to the stream surface area. Large temporal variations with maximum values shortly before spring snowmelt and in summer emphasise the need for investigations at higher temporal resolution. We improved the model uncertainty by incorporating groundwater data to better constrain the isotope compositions of initial {DIC}. Due to the large global abundance of acidic, humic-rich headwaters, we underline the importance of this integral approach for global applications.{\textless}br},

The Guadalupe aquifer in Baja California provides water to 57\% of the Mexican wine industry. Recent plans foresee a partial replenishment of its depleted groundwater reserves by transferring treated waste water from the Mexico-{USA} border for irrigation. The aquifer demonstrated to have a rapid response by rising the water table of about +20 m in relation to natural recharge under an intense rainfall period of 236 mm. Two predominant recharge sources were identified based on a geochemical multi-tracer approach: (a) water of modern age ({\textless}5 yr, {\textgreater}1.8 {TU}) and mixed water of recent-submodern age ($^{\textrm{3}}$H 0.8–1.8 {TU}), and (b) sub-modern waters that were recharged before 1952 ($^{\textrm{3}}$H {\textless} 0.5 {TU}). Water of the first type originate in the main Guadalupe stream, which has a more depleted average δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O isotope value (−7.8‰) than average local rainwater (−2.0‰). The stream water initially has a Na-{HCO}3 composition and recharges the entire Calafia zone and most groundwater along the riverbed across the valley. Water of the second type is mostly derived from hill-slope groundwater that has a stable isotope composition of mixed local rainwater and a Na[sbnd]Cl composition. High total dissolved solids {\textgreater}2 g l$^{\textrm{−1}}$ together with enriched {NO}3 $^{\textrm{−}}$ and Se concentrations characterize groundwater in the downstream the Porvenir zone. The geochemical age of this older, hill-slope groundwater suggests that its replenishment takes at least several decades when it becomes exhausted.},

	abstract = {At present most knowledge on the impact of iron on O-18 / O-16 ratios (i.e. delta O-18) of dissolved oxygen ({DO}) under circum-neutral conditions stems from experiments carried out under controlled laboratory conditions. These showed that iron oxidation leads to an increase in delta O-18({DO}) values. Here we present the first study on effects of elevated Fe({II}) concentrations on the delta O-18({DO}) in a natural, iron-rich, circum-neutral watercourse. Our results show that iron oxidation was the major factor for rising dissolved oxygen isotope compositions in the first 85m of the system in the cold season (February) and for the first 15m during the warm season (May). Further along the course of the stream, the delta O-18({DO}) decreased towards values known for atmospheric equilibration around +24.6 parts per thousand during both seasons. Possible drivers for these changes may be reduced iron oxidation, increased atmospheric exchange and {DO} production by oxygenic phototrophic algae mats. In the cold season, the delta O-18({DO}) values stabilized around atmospheric equilibrium, whereas in the warm season stronger influences by oxygenic photosynthesis caused values down to +21.8 parts per thousand. In the warm season from 145m downstream of the spring, the delta O-18({DO}) increased again until it reached atmospheric equilibrium. This trend can be explained by respiratory consumption of {DO} combined with a relative decrease in photosynthetic activity and increasing atmospheric influences. Our study shows that dissolved Fe({II}) can exert strong effects on the delta O-18({DO}) of a natural circum-neutral spring system even under constant supply of atmospheric O-2. However, in the presence of active photosynthesis, with supply of O-2 to the system, direct effects of Fe oxidation on the delta O-18({DO}) value become masked. Nonetheless, critical Fe({II}) concentrations may indirectly control {DO} budgets by enhancing photosynthesis, particularly if cyanobacteria are involved.},

	abstract = {Water supplies in coastal aquifers throughout the world are often threatened by salinization due to seawater intrusion and anthropogenic activities. In the Kalpitiya Peninsula in Sri Lanka, agricultural and domestic water supplies entirely depend on groundwater resources extracted from unconfined Holocene sandy aquifers. To differentiate the effects of seawater intrusion and agriculture on the coastal aquifers of this 160 km$^{\textrm{2}}$ peninsula, 43 groundwater samples were collected. These samples were analyzed for major ions, trace elements, and stable isotopes of water (δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O and δ$^{\textrm{2}}$H). The solute compositions were dominated by Cl$^{\textrm{−}}$, {SO}42−, and {HCO}3−, which were mostly balanced by Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$, Na$^{\textrm{+}}$, and Mg$^{\textrm{2+}}$. Among the four main water types, Na$^{\textrm{+}}$-Cl$^{\textrm{−}}$ and Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$-{SO}42− classifications were predominant in the investigated aquifers. Modifications of the groundwater due to evaporation during irrigation activities, but also due to seawater intrusion seem most plausible as indicated by the correlation of δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O with δ$^{\textrm{2}}$H (δ$^{\textrm{2}}$H = 5.51 * δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O-3.08, r = 0.93) deviating from the local meteoric water line. Particularly in the southern part of the peninsula, Mg$^{\textrm{2+}}$/Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$ ratios and stable isotopes of water attributed salinization of groundwater to agricultural activities. However, especially in the north, seawater intrusions were also evident. Established mass balance calculations revealed that local groundwater had seawater admixtures of up to 12\%. Our results indicate that integrated water management is essential and water resources should critically monitor in the Kalpitiya Peninsula in order to avoid over-exploitation and further seawater inflows.},

Associated intense mantle degassing occurs at the Hartoušov Mofette, a representative site for the Cheb Basin. Here, we performed 14 sampling campaigns between June 2019 and March 2020. Gas samples of fluids ascending in two boreholes (F1, ∼28 m depth and F2, ∼108 m depth) and from a nearby natural mofette were analyzed for their chemical ({CO}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, Ar, He, {CH}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}, and H{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) and isotope compositions (noble gases and {CO}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}). {CO}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} concentrations were above 99.1\% in most samples, while O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and N{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} were below 0.6\%. He ranged from 19 to 34 μmol/mol and {CH}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} was mostly below 12 μmol/mol. Isotope compositions of helium and carbon in {CO}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} ranged from 5.39 to 5.86 R{\textless}inf{\textgreater}A{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} and from −2.4 to −1.3 ‰ versus {VPDB}, respectively. Solubility differences of the investigated gases resulted in fluctuations of their chemical compositions. These differences were accompanied by observed changes of gas fluxes in the field and at the monitoring station for F1. Variations in solubilities and fluxes also impacted the chemical concentration of the gases and the δ$^{\textrm{13}}$C values that were also likely influenced by Fischer-Tropsch type reactions. The combination of (a) the Bernard ratio, (b) {CH}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}/$^{\textrm{3}}$He distributions, (c) P-T conditions, (d) heat flow, and (e) the sedimentary regime led to the hypothesis that {CH}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} may be of mixed biogenic and volcanic/geothermal origin with a noticeable atmospheric contribution. The drilling of a third borehole (F3) with a depth of ∼238 m in August 2019 has been crucial for providing insights into the complex system of Hartoušov Mofette.},

	abstract = {Karst areas and their catchments pose a great challenge for protection because fast conduit flow results in low natural attenuation of anthropogenic contaminants. Studies of the hydrochemistry of karst sources and river solutes are an important tool for securing and managing water resources. A study of the geochemical downriver evolution of the Wiesent River and its tributaries, located in a typical karst terrain, revealed unexpected downstream decreases of nitrate with maximum mean values of 30mg/L at the source to minimum values of 18mg/L near the river mouth. This trend persisted over the length of the river even though increased agricultural activities are evident in the downstream section of the catchment. This pattern is caused by fertilizer inputs via diffusive and fast conduits flow from karst lithology in the upstream area that may have reached the river's source even from beyond the hydrological catchment boundaries. Further downstream, these influences became diluted by tributary inputs that drain subcatchments dominated by claystone and sandstone lithologies that increased potassium and sulphate concentrations. Our findings indicate that bedrock geology remains the dominant control on the major ion chemistry of the Wiesent River and that agricultural influences are strongest near the headwaters despite increased land use further downstream, due to long-term storage and accumulation in karst aquifers. This feature may not be unique to the Wiesent River system, as carbonates cover significant portions of the Earth's surface and subsequent work in other river systems could establish whether such patterns are ubiquitous worldwide.},

	abstract = {A representative fluid sampling of surface geothermal manifestations and its analytical data quality assurance and quality control ({QA}/{QC}) are challenging aspects of understanding the geothermal reservoir processes. To achieve these goals, an interlaboratory test for the chemical analyses of ten water samples: one synthetic water, two lake waters (i.e., duplicated), one stream water, and six water samples from two geothermal wells of Los Azufres Geothermal field ({LAGF}), Michoacan, Mexico, was conducted. The geothermal wells were sampled at four points: (1) total discharge of condensed fluid at the wellhead, (2) separate liquid condensed in the well separator, (3) flushed liquid at the weir box, and (4) separated vapor condensed at the well-separator (data taken from Verma et al., 2022). Sixteen laboratories from ten countries reported their results. The {pH}, electrical conductivity, Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$, Li$^{\textrm{+}}$, {SO}4$^{\textrm{2−}}$, B, and Si-total measurements were 8.35 ± 0.04, 12.25 ± 0.53 {mS}/cm, 25 ± 1 mg/l, 18 ± 1 mg/l, 569 ± 33 mg/l, 320 ± 21 mg/l, and 20.5 ± 0.7 mg/l, which are close to the conventional true values, 8.40, 12.31 {mS}/cm, 23 mg/l, 19 mg/l, 647 mg/l, 330 mg/l, and 20.0 mg/l, respectively. Analytical errors for major ions, Na$^{\textrm{+}}$, Cl$^{\textrm{−}}$ and {CO}2-Total are 17, 21, and 42 percent, respectively; however, the analytical uncertainties are relatively lower, except for {CO}2-Total (19\%). Similarly, the analytical uncertainty for {CO}2-Total measurements of the lake water sample is 18\%. Thus, the analytical method of individual laboratories for {CO}2-Total measurements needs revision. The {NIST} Uncertainty Machine web app was used for the stepwise geothermal reservoir fluid composition calculation with uncertainty propagation from the samples collected at different points of a geothermal well. The wellhead fluid sample does not represent the geothermal reservoir fluid, including the sample collected by connecting a portable separator at the wellhead. The samples collected at points 2 and 3 represent equally well for non-volatile species; however, the sample collected at point 2 is a better representative of geothermal reservoir fluid in analyzing the {pH} and alkalinity values. It is associated with considering the effect of non-condensable gases ({CO}2, H2S, etc.) liberated at the silencer of the weir box. The geothermal reservoir fluid {pH} uncertainty, an essential parameter for geochemical modeling, is three to four times the measured fluid {pH} uncertainty due to the propagation process. Thus, the alkalinity measurement and its calculation procedure of geothermal fluid need revision to understand its correction for the boric, silicic, and other alkalinities.},

	abstract = {Stable carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotope ratios of sedimentary organic matter ({OM}) can reflect the biogeochemical history of aquatic ecosystems. However, diagenetic processes in sediments may alter isotope records of {OM} via microbial activity and preferential degradation of isotopically distinct organic components. This study investigated the isotope alteration caused by preferential degradation in surface sediments sampled from a eutrophic reservoir in Germany. Sediments were treated sequentially with hot water extraction, hydrochloric acid hydrolysis, hydrogen peroxide oxidation and di-sodium peroxodisulfate oxidation to chemically simulate preferential degradation pathways of sedimentary {OM}. Residue and extracts from each extraction step were analyzed using elemental analyzer-isotope ratio mass spectrometry and solid-state $^{\textrm{13}}$C nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. Our results show that stable C and N isotope ratios reacted differently to changes in the biochemical composition of sedimentary {OM}. Preferential degradation of proteins and carbohydrates resulted in a 1.2‰ depletion of $^{\textrm{13}}$C, while the isotope composition of $^{\textrm{15}}$N remained nearly the same. Sedimentary δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N values were notably altered when lignins and lipids were oxidized from residual sediments. Throughout the sequential fractionation procedure, δ$^{\textrm{13}}$C was linearly correlated with the C:N of residual sediments. This finding demonstrates that changes in biochemical composition caused by preferential degradation altered δ$^{\textrm{13}}$C values of sedimentary {OM}, while this trend was not observed for δ$^{\textrm{15}}$N values. Our study identifies the influence of preferential degradation on stable C isotope ratios and provide additional insight into the isotope alteration caused by post-depositional processes.},

	abstract = {We present a preliminary investigation of geological, climatic and anthropogenic influences on groundwater geochemistry in Sri Lanka. This spatially confined island of about 65,000 km$^{\textrm{2}}$ offers excellent boundary conditions for such an overview because it can be separated into two major geological and three climatic domains. Summary parameters, including electrical conductivity ({EC}) and total hardness ({TH}), were chosen as best proxies because they belong to the most frequently measured parameters of this data set. Groundwater quality data are presented from a total of 1318 groundwater samples. They were grouped into selected geo-climatic domains. Groundwater in the dry zone showed higher median {EC} and {TH} values (740 μS cm$^{\textrm{−1}}$ and 199 mg L$^{\textrm{−1}}$) when compared to the intermediate (400 μS cm$^{\textrm{−1}}$ and 120 mg L$^{\textrm{−1}}$) and wet zones (146 μScm$^{\textrm{−1}}$ and 53 mg L$^{\textrm{−1}}$). The sedimentary terrain of the county could be characterized by the highest median {EC} and {TH} values (1006 μS cm$^{\textrm{−1}}$ and 261 mg L$^{\textrm{−1}}$). In the metamorphic terrain that covers over 90\% of the island, {EC} and {TH} values showed the strongest spatial variations that likely depend on climatic conditions. A correlation between {EC} and {TH} correlated with an r of +0.70. This trend suggests that {EC} can also serve as a robust indirect indicator of groundwater {TH}. Excessive evaporation, seawater intrusion and agricultural return flows affect groundwater quality, mostly in coastal regions, where freshwater demand increases. Sustainable groundwater management demands continuous and comprehensive monitoring of spatial and temporal fluctuations of groundwater. We also propose managed aquifer recharge to protect the long-term sustainability of groundwater in both sedimentary and metamorphic domains. This becomes particularly important under projected climate change scenarios in which drier regions in the country are expected to expand.},

Oxygen (O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) contents in the headspace and its isotopes (δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}O2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) ranged from 2.62 to 3.20 mmol · L$^{\textrm{−1}}$ and from +9.8‰ to +21.9‰. Headspace samples showed less fluctuations in concentration and isotope trends because aquatic processes were hardly able to alter signals once the gas had reached the headspace. Headspace δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}O2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} values were corrected for gas–water equilibration and were determined to be higher than the mean δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}H2O{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} of −8.7‰. This finding suggests that counteracting respiration was important even during the highest photosynthetic activity. Additionally, headspace analyses led to the definition of a fractionation factor for respiration (α{\textless}inf{\textgreater}R{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) of this cyanobacterium with a value of 0.980. This value confirms the one commonly used for cyanobacteria. Our findings may become important for the management of water bodies where decreases in {DO} are caused by cyanobacteria.},

	abstract = {Turnover of organic matter ({OM}) is an essential ecological function in inland water bodies and relevant for water quality especially for the potential of dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) removal as well as due to emissions of {CO}2. We investigated various sources of {OM} including {DOC}, autochthonous particulate organic carbon (allo-{POC}), allochthonous particulate organic carbon (allo-{POC}), and sedimentary matter ({SED}) in a temperate drinking water reservoir (Rappbode Reservoir, Germany) with respect to carbon isotope ratios and concentration dynamics. For this purpose, we focused on the metalimnion and the hypolimnion, where respiratory turnover is expected to be dominant and hardly disturbed by atmospheric exchange. The observation period of nine months covered a complete stratification period of the water body. Dissolved inorganic carbon ({DIC}) concentrations and its isotopes (delta C-13({DIC})) were considered together with isotope data of {DOC} and {POC} (delta C-13({DOC}) and delta C-13({POC})) as input parameters for mass balances. {DIC} concentrations ranged between 0.30 and 0.53 mmol L-1 , while delta C-13({DIC}) values were between -15.1 and -7.2 parts per thousand versus the {VPDB} (Vienna {PeeDee} Belemnite) standard. Values of delta(13)C({DOC} )and delta C-13(auto-{POC}) ranged between -28.8 and -27.6 parts per thousand and between -35.2 and -26.8 parts per thousand, respectively. Isotope compositions of sedimentary material and allochthonous {POC} were inferred from the literature with average values of delta C-13({SED}) = -30.7 parts per thousand, and delta C-13(allo-{POC}) = -31.8 parts per thousand. Comparison of {DIC} concentration gains and stable isotope mass balances showed that autochthonous {POC} from primary producers was the main contributor to {DIC} increases, while contributions from {DOC}, {ExtPOC} and {SED} played a minor role. {OM} turnover rates, i.e. the conversion of organic carbon towards {DIC}, calculated with our isotope approach were within the range for oligotrophic water bodies (0.01 to 1.3 mu mol L(-1 )d(-1)). Some higher values in the metalimnion are likely due the availability of settling {POC} from the photic zone. Samples from a Metalimnetic Oxygen Minimum ({MOM}) showed a clear dominance of respiration over photosynthesis through bacterial degradation of autochthonous {POC}. These high turnover rates further highlight a close link with planktonic biological assemblages. Our work shows that respiration in temperate lentic water bodies largely depends on autochthonous {POC} production as a major carbon source},

	abstract = {Parameterization of transformation and transport processes of dissolved organic carbon ({DOC}) in soils is challenging especially under variable hydrological conditions. In this study, {DOC} concentrations in stormflow were analysed with a physically based modelling approach. A one-dimensional dual-continuum vertical flow and transport model was applied to simulate subsurface processes in a macroporous forest hillslope soil over a period of 4.5 years. Microbially mediated transformations of {DOC} were assumed to depend primarily on soil moisture and soil temperature. Two conceptually different descriptions of the sorption of {DOC} to soil were examined with equilibrium and kinetic approaches. In order to quantify the uncertainties associated with the model parameterization, Monte Carlo analyses in conjunction with Latin hypercube sampling was performed. Despite the complexity of microbial transformations, the simulated temporal patterns of {DOC} concentrations in stormflow showed similar behaviour to those reflected in the observed {DOC} fluxes. Due to preferential flow, the hillslope {DOC} export (5.0 ± 0.5 g C · m$^{\textrm{−2}}$ · year$^{\textrm{−1}}$) was higher than the amounts usually reported in the literature. Overall {DOC} transport in hillslope scenarios could be described appropriately using the equilibrium sorption assumption. The performed analyses showed that the inclusion of the kinetic description of {DOC} sorption only slightly improved the predictions of the {DOC} hillslope export. Moreover, influences of seasonal hydro-climatological conditions on hillslope export of {DOC} could be observed. Reduced {DOC} transport during an extreme warm and dry summer was described with lower accuracy, thus indicating the difficulties in the representation of {DOC} transformations under dry conditions.},

	abstract = {Humic substances ({HS}) in sediments play an important role in carbon and nutrient biogeochemical cycles and fate of contaminants in the environment. However, information regarding {HS} quality and transformations that may affect their behaviour in reservoirs is still limited. The aim of this investigation was to track sources and changes in sedimentary {HS} across a subtropical reservoir, connecting them to in lake processes and land-use influences. Surface sediments were collected at seven sampling sites in Itupararanga Reservoir (Brazil). Humic ({HA}) and fulvic ({FA}) acids (components of {HS}) were extracted from the sediment samples followed by in-depth characterisation via {UV}/{VIS}, fluorescence spectroscopy, elemental (C, N) and isotopic analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15), nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 {NMR}) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry ({FT}-{ICR}-{MS}). All data were analysed by self organising maps. The results showed that samples from the upstream part of the reservoir were older and more decomposed. They likely originated from C3 land-plants (delta C-13 varied from -26.3 parts per thousand to -22.4 parts per thousand), having more aromatic, oxygen-poor (O/C {\textless} 0.5) and unsaturated compounds (H/C 1.1). In contrast, near-dam samples were younger and had larger contributions of autochthonous material. This was confirmed by oxygen-rich (O/C 0.5) and partly more unsaturated compounds for {FA} as well as oxygen poor and saturated compounds with H/C {\textgreater} 1.1 for {HA}. Self-organising maps pointed out these differences between upstream and dam areas and indicated that agriculture lands were related to microbiallyderived {HS}. Changes in {HS} composition revealed that internal reservoir processes may have influenced {HS} quality across the reservoir. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

	abstract = {Understanding the critical thresholds of dissolved oxygen (O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}) that trigger adaptive physiological responses in aquatic organisms is long hampered by a lack of robust, non-lethal or non-invasive methodologies. The isotope fractionation of triple O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} isotopes ($^{\textrm{18}}$O/$^{\textrm{17}}$O/$^{\textrm{16}}$O) during respiration is linked to the amount of oxygen utilised, offering a potential avenue for new insights. Our experimental research involved measuring the oxygen isotope fractionation of dissolved O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} in closed-system aquatic respirometry experiments with wild sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). These fish were either naturally adapted or experimentally acclimated to hypoxic and normoxic conditions. The aim was to observe their oxygen usage and isotope fractionation in response to increasingly severe hypoxia. Initial observations revealed a progressive $^{\textrm{18}}$O enrichment from the preferential uptake of $^{\textrm{16}}$O to a dissolved oxygen threshold of 3–5 mg O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} L$^{\textrm{–1}}$, followed by an apparent reversal in oxygen isotope fractionation, which is mixing of $^{\textrm{16}}$O and $^{\textrm{17}}$O with the remaining O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} pool across all populations and indicative of a systematic change in oxygen metabolism among the fish. Unexpectedly, sticklebacks adapted to hypoxia but acclimated to normoxia exhibited stronger oxygen isotope fractionation compared to those adapted to normoxia and acclimated to hypoxia, contradicting the hypothesis that hypoxia adaptation would lead to reduced isotope discrimination due to more efficient oxygen uptake. These preliminary experimental results highlight the novel potential of using dissolved O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}2{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} isotopes as a non-invasive, non-lethal method to quantitatively assess metabolic thresholds in aquatic organisms. This approach could significantly improve our understanding of the critical oxygen responses and adaptation mechanisms in fish and other aquatic organisms across different oxygen environments, marking a significant step forward in aquatic ecological and physiological research.},

	abstract = {Dissolved oxygen ({DO}) dynamics of a temperate drinking water reservoir in the Harz Mountains (Germany) were investigated over a time period of 18 months. Via depth profiles in a fortnightly sampling resolution we were able to trace {DO} and temperature dynamics including the formation and breakdown of a Metalimnetic Oxygen Minimum ({MOM}) by means of {DO} concentration, saturation patterns and stable isotope ratios of dissolved oxygen (expressed as δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{DO}{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}). Over the evaluation period, 19.4 \% of the samples collected had δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{DO}{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} values compatible with atmospheric equilibration (+24.6 ‰ ± 0.4 ‰). With values smaller and larger than this threshold, the remaining δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{DO}{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} values showed that 40.8 \% of our samples were dominated by photosynthesis and 39.8 \% by respiration. From December to April the reservoir was mixed and {DO} consumption by respiration exceeded production via photosynthesis. During stratification period, quantification of respiration/photosynthesis rates (R/P) confirmed the epilimnion as a photosynthetic (i.e. net-autotrophic) environment while the hypolimnion was heterotrophic and dominated by respiration at various degrees. Samples of the {MOM} zone showed the highest R/P ratios and had among the most positive δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O{\textless}inf{\textgreater}{DO}{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} signals caused by respiration. This study showed that combinations of {DO} concentrations and their isotope ratios are promising to quantify critical zones of respiration and photosynthesis in aquatic environments.},

	abstract = {Since at least two decades, Chronic Kidney Disease of Uncertain Etiology ({CKDu}) has become an increasingly discussed health issue in Sri Lanka and as well as in other tropical regions. Areas that are particularly affected with the disease are mostly located in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The disease is more prominent among communities that consume groundwater as their main source of drinking water. Hydrogeochemical investigations were carried out in the Ginnoruwa area, a known hotspot of {CKDu}. It revealed possible links between drinking water chemistry and the spreading of the disease. This work compares hydrogeochemical data of drinking water sources of wells whose consumers are affected by {CKDu} and other nearby wells whose consumers were not affected by the disease. A total of 63 groundwater samples were collected from selected wells. About one-third of these samples (i.e., 19) were collected from wells used by {CKDu} patients. Significantly higher values of {pH}, total hardness, electrical conductivity, Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$, Mg$^{\textrm{2+}}$, F$^{\textrm{−}}$, Cl$^{\textrm{−}}$, {PO}4 $^{\textrm{3−}}$, and {SO}4 $^{\textrm{2−}}$ were found in wells that were used by {CKDu} patients. Mean contents of Na$^{\textrm{+}}$, Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$, and Mg$^{\textrm{2+}}$ in {CKDu} affected wells were 33.8 mg/L, 30.1 mg/L, and 14.9 mg/L, respectively, compared to 23.1 mg/L, 26.7 mg/L, and 9.65 mg/L in non-{CKDu} wells. Differences in major ion geochemistry in groundwaters are possibly governed by variable time periods of water storage in fractured hard rock aquifers in this region. Hydrogeochemical parameters were statistically compared by a Mann–Whitney U test and indicated significant differences in total dissolved solids ({TDS}) (p = 0.016), {SO}4 $^{\textrm{2−}}$ (p = 0.005), {PO}4 $^{\textrm{3−}}$ (p = 0.030), F$^{\textrm{−}}$ (p = 0.048), Na$^{\textrm{+}}$ (p = 0.008), and Mg$^{\textrm{2+}}$(p = 0.008) between non-{CKDu} and {CKDu} wells at p = 0.050 level. Other suspected solutes such as nephrotoxic trace elements including As, Cd, and Pb were similar in both types of wells. They were also lower than the accepted guideline limits of the World Health Organization ({WHO}). Results of this study suggest that fluoride in drinking water in combination with water hardness may be one of the responsible factors for kidney damage and progression of the disease. This may be particularly the case when elevated amounts of Mg$^{\textrm{2+}}$ are present in hard groundwater.},

	abstract = {Post-depositional degradation of organic matter ({OM}) in freshwater sediments is crucial for driving the biogeochemical dynamics and influencing the carbon burial. This process also often causes diagenetic alteration on paleoenvironmental proxies. Yet, mechanisms behind degradation of sedimentary {OM} and depth-related variations in stable isotope ratios can so far only be explained in part. Degradation of sedimentary {OM} in two drinking water reservoirs with contrasting eutrophic and mesotrophic states and different catchment land use (agriculture versus forestry) was studied. A 4-step procedure was used to chemically separate sedimentary {OM} in terms of biochemical composition. Here we presented depth profiles of biochemical composition of sedimentary {OM} that helped to quantify preferential degradation of aquatic proteins and carbohydrates and the following removal of aquatic lipids. Sediment in the eutrophic reservoir, which reflected a larger contribution of algal-derived {OM} than the mesotrophic reservoir with a forest dominated catchment, was therefore subject to more intensive degradation of sedimentary {OM} along with delta C-13 and delta N-15 alterations. In addition, changes in the relative proportions of biochemical components in sedimentary {OM} had more pronounced impact on delta N-15 values relative to delta C-13. Our findings suggest that the lability of algae-derived {OM} leads to uncertainties for the estimation of carbon burial in water bodies and obscures paleo-limnological information derived from isotopic proxies. Post-depositional modifications are more pronounced in eutrophic freshwaters that accumulated more readily degradable {OM} of algal origin in their sediments. Recognition of these modifications will help constrain carbon burial rates of productive lakes and reservoirs and assess the role of reservoirs in carbon cycling.},

	doi = {10.1007/s10040-020-02109-x},
	abstract = {Hydrogeochemical data are used to better understand recharge dynamics and to support a hydrogeological conceptual model in a 2-km$^{\textrm{2}}$ watershed in a discontinuous permafrost zone in Nunavik, Canada. The watershed contains an upper (surficial) and lower aquifer within Quaternary deposits, above and below a marine silt layer containing ice-rich permafrost mounds. The analysis is based on water samples from precipitation, groundwater monitoring wells, ground ice in permafrost mounds, thermokarst lakes and a perennial stream. Groundwater geochemistry in both aquifers reflects young, poorly evolved waters, with mainly Ca-{HCO}3 water types and low mineralisation ranging from 11 to 158 mg/L total dissolved solids ({TDS}), implying short pathways and rapid travel times of a year or less. While relatively low, {TDS} signatures in groundwater and surface water show increasing values downgradient. Groundwater isotope values (δ$^{\textrm{18}}${OH}2O and δ$^{\textrm{2}}${HH}2O) are often strongly influenced by snowmelt, while those of thermokarst lakes show evidence of evaporation. Recharge along the cuesta contributes to a transverse component of groundwater flow within the valley with higher {TDS} and δ$^{\textrm{13}}${CDIC} values influenced by open-system weathering. Even where permafrost-free, the marine silt unit has a strong confining effect and plays a more important role on recharge dynamics than the discontinuous permafrost. Nevertheless, the vulnerability of these types of hydrogeological aquifer systems is expected to increase due to rapid recharge dynamics associated with the gradual loss of the confining effect of permafrost. This hydrogeochemical data set will be useful as a baseline to document impacts of permafrost degradation on the hydrogeological system.},

	abstract = {Geochemical and isotope data of karstic aquifer systems in the Mulankavil area in northwest Sri Lanka were investigated to constrain recharging and discharging mechanisms, and possible seawater intrusions. The electrical conductivity ({EC}) of groundwater was measured in the dry (n = 139) and rainy (n = 78) seasons to assess possible saltwater intrusions, from which 25 wells were selected for detailed geochemical analyses. Water isotope analyses (expressed as delta 2HH2O, delta 18OH2O) were measured in 32 wells for five months. The mean {EC} of groundwater during both seasons was 2,435 mu S/cm, and higher values from the coastal stretch indicated seawater intrusion. Increasing {EC} values in the dry period indicated a temporary inland saltwater wedge. High hydraulic gradients with rapidly discharging groundwater partially removed seawater intrusions during the monsoon season. Water isotopes in the region defined an individual evaporation line with delta 2HH2O= 6.69*delta 18OH2O -0.77 (r2 = 0.989), indicating a long enough residence time to allow evaporation before infiltration. Groundwater near sinkhole systems was found to be predominantly of the Ca-Mg-{HCO}3 type and changes to the Na-Cl type toward the coast. The results of this study revealed conduit systems in the karst subsurface as essential pathways for controlling seawater intrusion.},

	abstract = {Besides gas-water-exchange in surface waters, respiratory consumption of dissolved oxygen ({DO}) in adjacent riparian groundwater may trigger the addition of so far hardly explored sources from the unsaturated zone. These processes also systematically influence stable isotope ratios of {DO} and were investigated together with Cl$^{\textrm{\&minus;}}$ as a conservative tracer for water mixing in a near-river riparian groundwater system. The study focused on a losing stream section of the Selke River at the foot of the Harz Mountains (Germany). The study area exposed steep {DO} gradients between the stream water and riparian groundwater between April 2016 and May 2017. Our results indicated dominant influences of microbial community respiration with observed {DO} concentration gradients. These observations can be explained by {DO} from the river that is subject to fractionation by microbial respiration with a typical fractionation factor (\&alpha;$_{\textrm{r}}$) of 0.982. However, with such respiration dominance, we expected a simultaneous enrichment of \&delta;$^{\textrm{18}}$O$_{\textrm{{DO}}}$ towards values that are more positive than the well-known atmospheric O$_{\textrm{2}}$ signal of +23.9\&permil; versus the Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water standard ({VSMOW}). Surprisingly, our measurements revealed much lower \&delta;$^{\textrm{18}}$O$_{\textrm{{DO}}}$ values between +22\&permil; and +18\&permil; in the near-river groundwater. Mass balance calculations revealed that the {DO} pool in the shallow and unconfined aquifer receives contributions of up to about 80\% by diffusion of oxygen from the vadose zone with a distinctly lower isotope value than the one of the atmosphere. This finding about additional oxygen sources from the unsaturated zone has numerous ramifications for oxygen related processes in near-river environments including the oxidation of pollutants, nutrients and ecosystem health.},

	abstract = {Chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology ({CKDu}) occurs in tropical countries, including Latin America, Mexico, Sri Lanka, and India. The disease occurs mainly in men who work in the agricultural sector. Although many studies have been conducted in {CKDu} areas, hardly any have examined emerging organic contaminants ({EOCs}) in drinking water. Therefore, this study examined {EOCs}, including pesticide residues, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, in 29 shallow groundwater samples collected from wells commonly used by {CKDu} patients. These patients were identified through renal biopsy examinations from the Girandurukotte and Wilgamuwa regions in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Of 110 {EOCs} measured, 40 were found in at least one or more samples. Among the detected {EOCs}, all groundwater samples examined showed the highest concentrations of caffeine (max: 950 ng/L) and {DEET} (max: 647 ng/L). In particular, the insect repellents commonly used in the region, such as coils, mats, vaporizers, spray and creams, would be the source of {DEET} in the environment. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products were the most common {EOCs} in all groundwater samples, with concentrations ranging from 129 (propylparaben) to 1.26 ng/L (carbamazepine) and 1.25 ng/L (hydrochlorothiazide), respectively, followed by herbicides and fungicides. Sources of such compounds would be insect repellents, antifungal and bactericidal preservatives, and agricultural pesticides. Notably, none of the identified {EOCs} reached critical values and were often below the values in European drinking water standards. Although primary evidence of {EOCs} as a cause of the disease does not emerge from the results of this study, regular monitoring of {EOCs} in groundwater, particularly in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, is essential as the presence of these compounds highlights their vulnerability in shallow groundwater wells.},

	abstract = {Water quality in reservoirs is often compromised in many regions worldwide by nutrients and trace metals. This demands continuous monitoring; however, analyses of large data sets collected during regular monitoring remain a difficult task. Multivariate techniques offer a fast and robust approach for interpreting complex results. The objective of this study was to check the efficacy of self-organizing maps ({SOMs}) as a tool to investigate biogeochemical processes. This tool can also help to illustrate influences of land use patterns on the water quality of reservoirs. Here we use the Itupararanga Reservoir in Brazil as a subtropical example. Vertical profiles were sampled from seven sites in the reservoir in a total of seven campaigns over 24 months. Next to physicochemical parameters in the water column (dissolved oxygen, Eh, {pH}, and temperature), levels of nutrients ({NO}3-, {NH}4+, and {PO}43-), transition and trace metals (Al, Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, and Zn), and chlorophyll-a (Chla) were measured. These variables were correlated with land use using {SOM}. With this technique samples were classified into 17 distinct groups that showed distinct influences of spatial heterogeneity and seasonality. The analyses helped to reveal a seasonal stratification period, where Fe, Mn, and P were released from sediments. Nutrients and some metal inputs (Al and Fe) were related to agricultural, urban, and grass/pasture areas around the reservoir. Our approach also helped to explain physical and biogeochemical seasonality in the reservoir.},

	abstract = {The identification and characterisation of diffuse pollutant sources in reservoirs remain a challenge due to the complexity of catchments with their variety of land use types. A sediment fingerprinting approach was used in this investigation for determining the sources of contaminants in sediments. By using this approach, we demonstrated how the effects of land use on pollution load of the subtropical Itupararanga Reservoir in Brazil can be de-convoluted. Sediments were collected at seven sampling sites (S1–S7) over the length of the reservoir. This was matched by eight sampling sites (P1–P8) of soils from different land use types (agriculture, urban and forest). Investigated parameters included grain size, total nitrogen ({TN}), total phosphorus ({TP}), total carbon ({TC}), organic matter by loss on ignition ({OM}), total sulphur ({TS}), and major ions and metals (Ca$^{\textrm{2+}}$, Mg$^{\textrm{2+}}$, Na$^{\textrm{+}}$, K$^{\textrm{+}}$, {NH}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{+}}${\textless}inf{\textgreater},{\textless}/inf{\textgreater} {SO}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}4{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{2−}}$, Cl$^{\textrm{−}}$, {NO}{\textless}inf{\textgreater}3{\textless}/inf{\textgreater}$^{\textrm{−}}$, As, Al, Ba, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mn, Ni and Zn). Our fingerprinting approach helped to outline horizontal spatial heterogeneities (categorised as riverine, transitional and lacustrine areas) that were attributed mainly to sand ({\textgreater} 26.7\%), Si (569 g kg$^{\textrm{−1}}$) and Cr (336 mg kg$^{\textrm{−1}}$) at S1 (riverine area). Moreover, fine particles of silt and clay leached from agricultural activities were enriched with {OM}, {TP}, {TN}, {TC}, As and Cr. These types of sediments were deposited into transitional and lacustrine areas. Furthermore, urban soils were a source of sand and phosphorus to sediments. The fingerprinting method reduced the number of relevant parameters for source identification and helped to identify non-point sources of sediments.},

	abstract = {For climate models that use paleo-environment data to predict future climate change, tree-ring isotope variations are one important archive for the reconstruction of paleo-hydrological conditions. Due to the rather complicated pathway of water, starting from precipitation until its uptake by trees and the final incorporation of its components into tree-ring cellulose, a closer inspection of seasonal variations of tree water uptake is important. In this study, branch and needle samples of two pine species (Pinus pinaster and Pinus nigra subsp. laricio) and several water compartments (precipitation, creek, soil) were sampled over a two-year period and analyzed for the temporal variations of their oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios (δ$^{\textrm{18}}$O and δ$^{\textrm{2}}$H) at five sites over an elevation gradient from sea level to around 1600 m a.s.l. on the Mediterranean island of Corsica (France). A new model was established to disentangle temporal relationships of source water uptake of trees. It uses a calculation method that incorporates the two processes mostly expected to affect source water composition: mixing of waters and evaporation. The model results showed that the temporal offset from precipitation to water uptake is not constant and varies with elevation and season. Overall, seasonal source water origin was shown to be dominated by precipitation from autumn and spring. While autumn precipitation was a more important water source for trees growing at mid- ( 800–1000 m a.s.l) and high-elevation ( 1600 m a.s.l.) sites, trees at coastal sites mostly took up water from late winter and spring. These findings show that predicted decreases in precipitation amounts during the wet season in the Mediterranean can have strong impacts on water availability for pine trees, especially at higher elevations.},

Recharge of this pivotal aqueous gas may become hampered by anthropogenic and climatic influences with so far unknown consequences for surface freshwater systems and entire ecosystems. Because rivers integrate biogeochemical information of catchments, their oxygen dynamics may also reflect ecosystem and landscape health. Here we summarize the most important sources and sinks of {DO} and its role in river systems. These considerations also extend to associated water compartments and fluxes including lakes, reservoirs, soils, groundwater and the hyporheic zone. In addition, for continental-scale considerations, we analysed the {GLObal} {RIver} {CHemistry} ({GLORICH}) database with 170,369 {DO} measurements. These analyses revealed that {DO} in rivers relates to water temperature, {pH} and nutrient availability. On larger scales, it is also influenced by catchment area, slope, ratios of forests to managed land and population density. Our review also highlights important links between physical and biological influences on {DO} transfer as well as its sources and sinks in streams and rivers. We conclude that {DO} monitoring should be combined with novel interdisciplinary tracing techniques such as stable isotope ratios, radon gas and biological analyses. Such combined analyses have the potential to improve our understanding of transfer and transformations of oxygen in rivers as essential integrators of landscapes.},

	abstract = {Climate models are in need of improved constraints for water vapor transport in the atmosphere, and tritium can serve as a powerful tracer in the hydrological cycle. Although the general principles of tritium distribution and transfer processes within and between the various hydrological compartments are known, variation on short timescales and aspects of altitude dependence are still under debate. To address questions regarding tritium sources, sinks, and transfer processes, the sampling of individual precipitation events in Corte on the island of Corsica in the Mediterranean Sea was performed between April 2017 and April 2018. Tritium concentrations of 46 event samples were compared to their moisture origin and corresponding air mass history. Air mass back-trajectories were generated from the novel high-resolution {ERA}5 dataset from the {ECMWF} (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). Geographical source regions with similar tritium concentrations were predefined using generally known tritium distribution patterns, such as the "continental effect", and from data records derived at long-term measurement stations of tritium in precipitation across the working area. Our model-derived source region tritium concentrations agreed well with annual mean station values. Moisture that originated from continental Europe and the Atlantic Ocean was most distinct regarding tritium concentrations with values up to 8.8 {TU} (tritium units) and near 0 {TU}, respectively. The seasonality of tritium values ranged from 1.6 {TU} in January to 10.1 {TU} in May, and they exhibited well-known elevated concentrations in spring and early summer due to increased stratosphere-troposphere exchange. However, this pattern was interrupted by extreme events. The average altitude of trajectories was correlated with the tritium concentrations in precipitation, especially in spring and early summer and if outlier values of extreme tritium concentrations were excluded. However, in combination with the trajectory information, these outlier values proved to be valuable for improving the comprehension of tritium movement in the atmosphere. Our work shows how event-based tritium research can advance the understanding of its distribution in the atmosphere.},

	abstract = {Key {messageBlack} pine and Maritime pine exhibit considerable differences in growth phenology across elevation belts with a 1-month delay for xylogenesis and increasing growth rates from low, mid to high elevations.Investigating seasonal wood formation is crucial to understand tree growth responses to climate impact. The present study quantifies the variability of xylogenesis along an elevation gradient on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, where two native pine species (Pinus nigra Arnold ssp. laricio Maire and Pinus pinaster Aiton) grow from the upper tree line to sea level, partly in sympatry. We extracted microcores from 35 trees at 5 sites along an East-West transect from the coasts (10 m asl) to the island's central mountain ridge (1600 m asl) during bi-weekly sampling campaigns between 2017 and 2019. We applied generalised additive models to detect radial growth differences in elevation and species along with minimum temperatures for growth initiation. We found that trees in low elevations experienced over 2 months longer growth periods with higher maximum growth rates than in high elevations. The results show a 1-month delay for the beginning of tracheid formation between the low, mid and high-elevation belts but comparable timing for its termination. At the sites where both species co-occur, P. nigra accumulates more radial cells in a shorter time than P. pinaster. Trees at the two contrasting coastal sites have similar growth period lengths, but exhibit a time shift of over a month. Minimum temperatures around growth initiation vary between 3.1 degrees C for P. nigra and 9.9 degrees C for P. pinaster. These findings emphasise the high plasticity in the growth behaviour of one of the most widespread tree genera in Mediterranean and temperate zones.},

	abstract = {Rhodoliths are nodules of non-geniculate coralline algae that occur in shallow waters ({\textless}150 m depth) subjected to episodic disturbance. Rhodolith beds stand with kelp beds, seagrass meadows, and coralline algal reefs as one of the world's four largest macrophyte-dominated benthic communities. Geographic distribution of rhodolith beds is discontinuous, with large concentrations off Japan, Australia and the Gulf of California, as well as in the Mediterranean, North Atlantic, eastern Caribbean and Brazil. Although there are major gaps in terms of seabed habitat mapping, the largest rhodolith beds are purported to occur off Brazil, where these communities are recorded across a wide latitudinal range (2°N - 27°S). To quantify their extent, we carried out an inter-reefal seabed habitat survey on the Abrolhos Shelf (16°50′ - 19°45′S) off eastern Brazil, and confirmed the most expansive and contiguous rhodolith bed in the world, covering about 20,900 km2. Distribution, extent, composition and structure of this bed were assessed with side scan sonar, remotely operated vehicles, and {SCUBA}. The mean rate of {CaCO}3 production was estimated from in situ growth assays at 1.07 kg m−2 yr−1, with a total production rate of 0.025 Gt yr−1, comparable to those of the world's largest biogenic {CaCO}3 deposits. These gigantic rhodolith beds, of areal extent equivalent to the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, are a critical, yet poorly understood component of the tropical South Atlantic Ocean. Based on the relatively high vulnerability of coralline algae to ocean acidification, these beds are likely to experience a profound restructuring in the coming decades.},

	abstract = {A solid understanding of global oceanic change throughout Holocene time is needed to contextualize and interpret recent observations of rapid warming (Moore, 2016), ocean acidification (Popova et al., 2014; Qi et al., 2017), increasing meltwater input (Halfar et al., 2013; Notz and Stroeve, 2016) and circulation changes (Liu et al., 2017; Rahmstorf et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2016) in the Arctic and subarctic Oceans. Precisely reconstructing acidification and temperature variations throughout the Holocene will provide a vital context for interpreting current environmental changes and future climate projections in the region. However, existing paleoenvironmental reconstructions are sparse and uncertain, largely owing to limited availability of high fidelity paleoceanographic archives, such as marine carbonates, in high latitude waters. Coralline algae of the genus Clathromorphum have emerged as key candidates for reconstructing high-latitude environmental variability at annual to sub-annual resolution. Here, we present the first empirical calibrations of boron isotope-{pH} and Mg/Li-temperature relationships within the long-lived, crustose coralline red alga Clathromorphum compactum. Calibration experiments were performed in triplicate, growing wild-collected specimens for four months at three controlled temperatures (6.4–12.4 °C) and four {pCO}2 conditions (352–3230 ppm), to test the effects of these environmental parameters on the isotopic and elemental composition of the algal skeleton. We find that boron isotopes within the skeleton of C. compactum (δ11Bcc) are well correlated with δ11B of seawater borate (δ11Βborate), defining the following equation: δ11Βcc (2σ) = 1.46 (0.06) δ11Βborate + 6.91 (0.72). This equation can be used to reconstruct δ11Βborate of the coralline alga's ambient seawater, from which past seawater {pH} can be calculated. We also identified a strong correlation between skeletal Mg/Li ratio and seawater temperature, defined by the equation: Mg/Li (2σ) = 0.17 (0.02) temperature ({oC}) + 1.02 (0.16). Therefore, despite the strong biological control that this species appears to exert on calcification site {pH} (elevated 1.0–1.6 {pH} units above seawater {pH}, inferred from δ11Bcc \&gt; δ11Βborate), and the apparent relationship between skeletal extension rate and skeletal Li/Ca and Mg/Ca, the δ11Bcc and Mg/Li ratios of the coralline alga's skeleton strongly and significantly respond to ambient seawater {pH} and temperature, respectively. These results support the use of δ11B and Mg/Li within C. compactum for {pH} and temperature reconstructions of northern high-latitude oceans. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd},

A Bank facies is built up by the unattached coralline algae Lithothamnium corallioides and Phymatolithon calcareum. This autochthonous facies occurs in shallow sheltered environments. In exposed areas a rippled Clean Algal Gravel facies is found composed of coralline and molluscan debris. In intermediate energy areas a Muddy Algal Gravel facies is found with small amounts of live corallines. Sheltered creeks have a Mud facies which is partly carbonate and partly terrigenous. The shallow water coralline algal sediments are overlapped by a Fine Sand facies of mixed biogenic composition. Each facies is characterized by particular phenotypic growth forms of the unattached corallines. Rates of organic calcium carbonate production are obtained which are found to be similar to rates from shallow tropical non-reef environments. The carbonate sediments of Mannin Bay are compared with similar sediments from Kilkerrin Bay. Ireland, from Brittany and from Falmouth Harbour. From these comparisons, facies models are proposed for these carbonate sediments. The major factor controlling facies distribution is coastal morphology. The present day shelf is considered to be too exposed to preserve complete sequences of the shallow water sediments.},

	abstract = {Ocean acidification ({OA}) is predicted to enhance photosynthesis in many marine taxa. However, photophysiology has multiple components that {OA} may affect differently, especially under different light environments, with potentially contrasting consequences for photosynthetic performance. Furthermore, because photosynthesis affects energetic budgets and internal acid-base dynamics, changes in it due to {OA} or light could mediate the sensitivity of other biological processes to {OA} (e.g. respiration and calcification). To better understand these effects, we conducted experiments on Porolithon onkodes, a common crustose coralline alga in Pacific coral reefs, crossing {pCO}2 and light treatments. Results indicate {OA} inhibited some aspects of photophysiology (maximum photochemical efficiency), facilitated others (alpha, the responsiveness of photosynthesis to sub-saturating light), and had no effect on others (maximum gross photosynthesis), with the first two effects depending on treatment light level. Light also exacerbated the increase in dark-adapted respiration under {OA}, but did not alter the decline in calcification. Light-adapted respiration did not respond to {OA}, potentially due to indirect effects of photosynthesis. Combined, results indicate {OA} will interact with light to alter energetic budgets and potentially resource allocation among photosynthetic processes in P. onkodes, likely shifting its light tolerance, and constraining it to a narrower range of light environments.},

We found a significant negative effect of increased {CO} 2 levels on the net calcification rates of L. glaciale in both experiments. Annual mean net dissolution of L. glaciale was estimated to start at an aragonite saturation state between 1.1 and 0.9 which is projected to occur in parts of the Arctic surface ocean between 2030 and 2050 if emissions follow 'business as usual' scenarios ({SRES} A2; {IPCC} 2007). The massive skeleton of {CCA}, which consist of more than 80\% calcium carbonate, is considered crucial to withstanding natural stresses such as water movement, overgrowth or grazing. The observed strong negative response of this Arctic {CCA} to increased {CO} 2 levels suggests severe threats of the projected ocean acidification for an important habitat provider in the Arctic coastal ocean. © Inter-Research 2011.},

	abstract = {In this paper the carbonate content and production, both at the species level and at the community level, is quantified in four areas of the Mallorca-Menorca shelf, northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Eight benthic communities are identified, each living at specific depth ranges and preferentially colonising either rocky or sedimented soft bottoms: (1) Photophilic algae, (2) Hemisciaphilic algae, (3) Coralligenous algal-dominated, (4) Coralligenous animal-dominated, (5) Caulerpa-Cymodocea meadows, (6) Posidonia oceanica meadows, (7) maërl and free-Peyssonelia beds, and (8) sandy bottom communities. Encrusting and maërl species of Corallinales and of the red algal genus Peyssonnelia and, to a lesser extent, the green alga Halimeda tuna, are the main carbonate producers. Most of the modern algal carbonate production in the Mallorca-Menorca shelf occurs at depths of less than 85–90 m, which is the lower limit of the coralligenous and maërl communities. Algal carbonate production in rocky areas is usually higher than that of soft bottoms, with the exception of the maërl beds in moderately deep waters (40–85 m). The highest algal carbonate production is found in coralligenous algal-dominated rocky bottoms (464.6 g m−2 year−1), photophilic algal communities (289.4 g m−2 year−1) and maërl beds (210 g m−2 year−1), while the lowest is displayed by seagrass meadows (60 to 70 g m−2 year−1) and sandy bottoms (0.5 g m−2 year−1). Nevertheless, the contribution of seagrass beds to benthic carbonate production in the Mallorca-Menorca shelf is outstanding due to the extent of the area occupied by these beds. The mean algal carbonate production rate over the upper 100 m water depth in the studied localities ranges from 90.60 to 123.89 g m−2 year−1, which correspond to the mostly sedimented Campos area and to the very rocky South Cabrera area, respectively. Overall mean carbonate production of the Mallorca-Menorca shelf is around 100 g {CO}3Ca m−2 year−1. These results may be viewed as a minimum estimate for total carbonate production on the Mallorca-Menorca shelf since they take into account only the phytobenthos.},

	abstract = {Abstract Rhodoliths are important marine carbonate producers that provide habitat for several marine organisms, and are threatened by ongoing global climate change. Meter-sized sedimentary patches rich in living rhodoliths, interspersed among corals, were discovered in the back reef of Ras Ghamila lagoon, Southern Sinai, at less than 1 m water depth. In this shallow and relatively sheltered subtropical environment, rhodoliths were found to be monospecific or oligospecific, spheroidal, 3.5 to 9.4 cm in maximum diameter, with warty/lumpy or fruticose (protuberance degree {IV}) growth forms, and corresponded to the unattached branches or praline type. They grew in bright light under seasonal, moderate, wind-driven water motion. The dominant rhodolith-forming species recorded were: Lithophyllum kotschyanum, Porolithon onkodes, Hydrolithon sp. and three species of Neogoniolithon: Neogoniolithon fosliei, Neogoniolithon brassica-florida, and an undescribed species noted in the text as Neogoniolithon sp. A total of 38 Alizarin-stained rhodoliths was released in the field and collected after 1 year. They showed different banding patterns (alternating long and short cells) that revealed seasonal growth, with the lowest rates occurring in winter for all species, and an additional summer growth slackening in Neogoniolithon fosliei. Lithophyllum kotschyanum presented evidence of occasional growth cessation, possibly due to temporary burial. The observed annual growth rate of rhodoliths was unrelated to their size. The mean accretion rates were 1.08 mm · year?1 in L. kotschyanum, 0.75 mm · year?1 in P. onkodes, 0.49 mm · year?1 in Hydrolithon sp., 0.85 mm mm · year?1 in N. fosliei, 0.63 mm · year?1 in N. brassica-florida and 0.57 mm · year?1 in Neogoniolithon sp. The annual mean marginal elongation rate for these taxa was respectively 8.74, 13.92, 3.59, 9.40 and 9.25 mm · year?1, with the exception of Neogoniolithon sp., for which this parameter was not recorded. Maximum marginal elongation occurred in P. onkodes pointing out its greater ability as a space competitor in comparison with the other rhodolith species. The highest accretion rate and common presence of L. kotschyanum indicate its importance as carbonate producer in tropical reef.},

	abstract = {Calcification by four species of crustose coralline algae was estimated on the windward reef at Lizard Island, northern Great Barrier Reef, Australia, by combining measurements of O2, {pH}, and total alkalinity with equations describing the seawater carbonate equilibrium. Calcification (C) was regressed against irradiance (I) and modeled using a general exponential function. C-I models yielded estimates of gross calcification that ranged from 9.6 mmol {CaCO}3 m−2 h−1 at 0 m to 2.0 mmol {CaCO}3 m−2 h−1 at 18 m. A significant proportion of all samples exhibited {CaCO}3 dissolution in the dark. Integration of C-I models with half sine-curve approximations of whole-day irradiance yielded estimated net deposition rates of 0.82 to 9.1 g {CaCO}3 m−2 d−1. Net 24-h calcification was linearly correlated with noontime irradiance. Daily {CaCO}3 deposition as a function of reef surface relief (3.1 for the crest and 5.0 for the slope) indicated potential contributions to reef accretion of 4.1 to 28.1 g m−2 d−1, assuming 100\% coralline cover. These estimates predict annual deposition rates of 1.5 to 10.3 kg {CaCO}3 m−2 yr−1, provided that measurements made between late summer and mid-winter are representative of calcification throughout the year. Since observed accretion falls far short of the quantities predicted by these measurements, erosive agencies must remove much of the {CaCO}3 deposited annually by crustose coralline algae on windward reef margins.},

However, long-term assessments of the impacts of {OA} are scarce, limiting the understanding of the capacity of corals and coralline algae to acclimatize to high partial pressure of carbon dioxide (p({CO})(2)) levels. Species-specific sensitivities to {OA} are influenced by its impacts on chemistry within the calcifying fluid ({CF}). Here, we investigate the capacity of multiple coral and calcifying macroalgal species to acclimatize to elevated p({CO})(2) by determining their chemistry in the {CF} during a year-long experiment. We found no evidence of acclimatization to elevated p({CO})(2) across any of the tested taxa. The effects of increasing seawater p({CO})(2) on the {CF} chemistry were rapid and persisted until the end of the experiment. Our results show that acclimatization of the {CF} chemistry does not occur within one year, which confirms the threat of {OA} for future reef accretion and ecological function.},

	abstract = {Natural variability in {pH} in the diffusive boundary layer ({DBL}), the discrete layer of seawater between bulk seawater and the outer surface of organisms, could be an important factor determining the response of corals and coralline algae to ocean acidification ({OA}). Here, two corals with different morphologies and one coralline alga were maintained under two different regimes of flow velocities, {pH}, and light intensities in a 12 flumes experimental system for a period of 27 weeks. We used a combination of geochemical proxies, physiological and micro-probe measurements to assess how these treatments affected the conditions in the {DBL} and the response of organisms to {OA}. Overall, low flow velocity did not ameliorate the negative effect of low {pH} and therefore did not provide a refugia from {OA}. Flow velocity had species-specific effects with positive effects on calcification for two species. {pH} in the calcifying fluid ({pHcf}) was reduced by low flow in both corals at low light only. {pHcf} was significantly impacted by {pH} in the {DBL} for the two species capable of significantly modifying {pH} in the {DBL}. The dissolved inorganic carbon in the calcifying fluid ({DICcf}) was highest under low {pH} for the corals and low flow for the coralline, while the saturation state in the calcifying fluid and its proxy ({FWHM}) were generally not affected by the treatments. This study therefore demonstrates that the effects of {OA} will manifest most severely in a combination of lower light and lower flow habitats for sub-tropical coralline algae. These effects will also be greatest in lower flow habitats for some corals. Together with existing literature, these findings reinforce that the effects of {OA} are highly context dependent, and will differ greatly between habitats, and depending on species composition.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenically-modulated reductions in {pH}, termed ocean acidification, could pose a major threat to the physiological performance, stocks, and biodiversity of calcifiers and may devalue their ecosystem services. Recent debate has focussed on the need to develop approaches to arrest the potential negative impacts of ocean acidification on ecosystems dominated by calcareous organisms. In this study, we demonstrate the role of a discrete (i.e. diffusion) boundary layer ({DBL}), formed at the surface of some calcifying species under slow flows, in buffering them from the corrosive effects of low {pH} seawater. The coralline macroalga Arthrocardia corymbosa was grown in a multifactorial experiment with two mean {pH} levels (8.05 'ambient' and 7.65 a worst case 'ocean acidification' scenario projected for 2100), each with two levels of seawater flow (fast and slow, i.e. {DBL} thin or thick). Coralline algae grown under slow flows with thick {DBLs} (i.e., unstirred with regular replenishment of seawater to their surface) maintained net growth and calcification at {pH} 7.65 whereas those in higher flows with thin {DBLs} had net dissolution. Growth under ambient seawater {pH} (8.05) was not significantly different in thin and thick {DBL} treatments. No other measured diagnostic (recruit sizes and numbers, photosynthetic metrics, \%C, \%N, \%{MgCO}3) responded to the effects of reduced seawater {pH}. Thus, flow conditions that promote the formation of thick {DBLs}, may enhance the subsistence of calcifiers by creating localised hydrodynamic conditions where metabolic activity ameliorates the negative impacts of ocean acidification.},

Despite intense research effort on coral reef calcium carbonate production, the inclusion of a key reef forming/accreting calcifying group, the crustose coralline algae, remains challenging both from a theoretical and practical standpoint. While corals are typically the primary reef builders of contemporary reefs, crustose coralline algae can contribute equally. Here, we combine several sets of data with numerical and theoretical modelling to demonstrate that crustose coralline algae carbonate production can match or even exceed the contribution of corals to reef carbonate production. Despite their importance, crustose coralline algae are often inaccurately recorded in benthic surveys or even entirely missing from coral reef carbonate budgets. We outline several recommendations to improve the inclusion of crustose coralline algae into such carbonate budgets under the ongoing climate crisis.},

	abstract = {Coralline algae provide important ecosystem services but are susceptible to the impacts of ocean acidification. However, the mechanisms are uncertain, and the magnitude is species specific. Here, we assess whether species-specific responses to ocean acidification of coralline algae are related to differences in {pH} at the site of calcification within the calcifying fluid/medium ({pHcf} ) using delta(11) B as a proxy. Declines in delta(11) B for all three species are consistent with shifts in delta(11) B expected if B({OH})4(-) was incorporated during precipitation. In particular, the delta(11) B ratio in Amphiroa anceps was too low to allow for reasonable {pHcf} values if B({OH})3 rather than B({OH})4(-) was directly incorporated from the calcifying fluid. This points towards delta(11) B being a reliable proxy for {pHcf} for coralline algal calcite and that if B({OH})3 is present in detectable proportions, it can be attributed to secondary postincorporation transformation of B({OH})4(-) . We thus show that {pHcf} is elevated during calcification and that the extent is species specific. The net calcification of two species of coralline algae (Sporolithon durum, and Amphiroa anceps) declined under elevated {CO}2 , as did their {pHcf} . Neogoniolithon sp. had the highest {pHcf} , and most constant calcification rates, with the decrease in {pHcf} being (1/4) that of seawater {pH} in the treatments, demonstrating a control of coralline algae on carbonate chemistry at their site of calcification. The discovery that coralline algae upregulate {pHcf} under ocean acidification is physiologically important and should be included in future models involving calcification.},

	abstract = {The increase in atmospheric carbon dioxide ({CO}2) observed since the industrial revolution has reduced surface ocean {pH} by similar to 0.1 {pH} units, with further change in the oceanic system predicted in the coming decades. Calcareous organisms can be negatively affected by extreme changes in seawater {pH} ({pH}(sw)) such as this due to the associated changes in the oceanic carbonate system. The boron isotopic composition (delta(11) B) of biogenic carbonates has been previously used to monitor {pH} at the calcification site ({pH}(cf)) in scleractinian corals, providing mechanistic insights into coral biomineralisation and the impact of variable {pH}(sw) on this process. Motivated by these investigations, this study examines the delta(11) B of the high-Mg calcite skeleton of the coralline red alga Neogoniolithon sp. to constrain {pH}(cf), and investigates how this taxon's {pH}(cf) is impacted by ocean acidification. delta B-11 was measured in multiple algal replicates (n = 4-5) cultured at four different {pCO}(2) scenarios-averaging (+/- 1 sigma) 409 (+/- 6), 606 (+/- 7), 903 (+/- 12) and 2856 (+/- 54) mu atm, corresponding to average {pH}(sw) (+/- 1 sigma) of 8.19 (+/- 0.03), 8.05 (+/- 0.06), 7.91 (+/- 0.03) and 7.49 (+/- 0.02) respectively. Results show that skeletal delta(11) B is elevated relative to the delta(11) B of seawater borate at all {pH}(sw) treatments by up to 18\%. Although substantial variability in delta(11) B exists between replicate samples cultured at a given {pH}(sw) (smallest range = 2.32\% at {pHsw} 8.19, largest range = 6.08\% at {pH}(sw) 7.91), strong correlations are identified between delta(11) B and {pH}(sw) (R-2 = 0.72, p {\textless} 0.0001, n = 16) and between delta(11) B and B/Ca (R-2 = 0.72, p {\textless} 0.0001, n = 16). Assuming that skeletal delta(11) B reflects {pH}(cf) as previously observed for scleractinian corals, the average {pH}(cf) across all experiments was 1.20 {pH} units (0.79 to 1.56) higher than {pH}(sw), with the magnitude of this offset varying parabolically with decreasing {pH}(sw), with a maximum difference between {pH}(sw) and {pH}(cf) at a {pH}(sw) of 7.91. Observed relationships between {pH}(sw) and calcification rate, and between {pH}(sw) and {pH}(cf), suggest that coralline algae exhibit some resilience to moderate ocean acidification via increase of {pH}(cf) relative to {pH}(sw) in a similar manner to scleractinian corals. However, these results also indicate that {pH}(cf) cannot be sufficiently increased by algae exposed to a larger reduction in {pH}(sw), adversely impacting calcification rates of coralline red algae.

Abundant and ecologically important coralline algae may be particularly susceptible to {OA}; however, multi-stressor studies and those on articulated morphotypes are lacking. Here, we use field observations and laboratory experiments to elucidate the impacts of warming and acidification on growth, calcification, mineralogy, and photophysiology of the temperate articulated coralline alga, Calliarthron tuberculosum. We conducted a 4-week fully factorial mesocosm experiment exposing individuals from a southern {CA} kelp forest to current and future temperature and {pH}/{pCO}2 conditions (+2°C, −0.5 {pH} units). Calcification was reduced under warming (70\%) and further reduced by high {pCO}2 or high {pCO}2 x warming ({\textasciitilde}150\%). Growth (change in linear extension and surface area) was reduced by warming (40\% and 50\%, respectively), high {pCO}2 (20\% and 40\%, respectively), and high {pCO}2 x warming (50\% and 75\%, respectively). The maximum photosynthetic rate (Pmax) increased by 100\% under high {pCO}2 conditions, but we did not detect an effect of {pCO}2 or warming on photosynthetic efficiency (α). We also did not detect the effect of warming or {pCO}2 on mineralogy. However, variation in Mg incorporation in cell walls of different cell types (i.e., higher mol \% Mg in cortical vs. medullary) was documented for the first time in this species. These results support findings from a growing body of literature suggesting that coralline algae are often more negatively impacted by warming than {OA}, with the potential for antagonistic effects when factors are combined. © 2022 The Authors.

	abstract = {Crustose coralline algae ({CCA}) cement reefs and create important habitat and settling sites for reef organisms. The susceptibility of {CCA} to increasing ocean {pCO}(2) and declining {pH} or ocean acidification ({OA}) is a growing concern. Although {CCA} are autotrophs, there has been little focus on the interaction of elevated {pCO}(2) and irradiance. We examined elevated {pCO}(2) effects on individual {CCA} and macroalgal benthic communities at high and low irradiance (205 13 mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) in an aquaria experiment (35 d, June August 2014) on Little Cayman Island, Caribbean. A dominant Cayman reef wall {CCA} (Peyssonnelia sp.) in its adult lobed form and individual {CCA} recruits were used as experimental units. Changes in {CCA}, fleshy macroalgae (branching and turfs), and microalgae (including microbial biofilm) per cent cover and frequency were examined on macroalgal communities that settled onto plates from the reef. Reef diel cycles of {pCO}(2) and {pH} were simulated using seawater inflow from a back reef. Although {CO}2 enrichment to year 2100 levels resulted in 1087 mu atm {pCO}(2) in the elevated {pCO}(2) treatment, {CaCO}3 saturation states remained high (Omega(cal) {\textgreater}= 2.7). Under these conditions, elevated {pCO}(2) had no effect on Peyssonnelia sp. calcification rates or survival regardless of irradiance. Individual {CCA} surface area on the bottom of settling plates was lower under elevated {pCO}(2), but per cent cover or frequency within the community was unchanged. In contrast, there was a strong and consistent community assemblage response to irradiance. Microalgae increased at high irradiance and {CCA} increased under low irradiance with no significant {pCO}(2) interaction. Based on this short-term experiment, tropical macroalgal communities are unlikely to shift at {pCO}(2) levels predicted for year 2100 under high or low irradiance. Rather, irradiance and other factors that promote microalgae are likely to be strong drivers of tropical benthic algal community structure under climate change.},

To test this hypothesis, the effect of elevated {pCO}(2) was investigated in the articulated coralline red alga Corallina elongata from an intertidal rock pool on the north coast of Brittany (France), where {pCO}(2) naturally varied daily between 70 and 1000 mu atm. Metabolism was measured on algae in the laboratory after they had been grown for 3 weeks at {pCO}(2) concentrations of 380, 550, 750 and 1000 mu atm. Net and gross primary production, respiration and calcification rates were assessed by measurements of oxygen and total alkalinity fluxes using incubation chambers in the light and dark. Calcite mol \% Mg/Ca ({mMg}/Ca) was analysed in the tips, branches and basal parts of the fronds, as well as in new skeletal structures produced by the algae in the different {pCO}(2) treatments. Respiration, gross primary production and calcification in light and dark were not significantly affected by increased {pCO}(2). Algae grown under elevated {pCO}(2) (550, 750 and 1000 mu atm) formed fewer new structures and produced calcite with a lower {mMg}/Ca ratio relative to those grown under 380 mu atm. This study supports the assumption that C. elongata from a tidal pool, where {pCO}(2) fluctuates over diel and seasonal cycles, is relatively robust to elevated {pCO}(2) compared to other recently investigated coralline algae.},

	abstract = {Vermetid reefs in the Mediterranean Sea are increasingly affected by both anthropogenic actions and global climate change, which are putting this coastal ecosystem at risk. The main species involved in building these reefs are two species of intertidal vermetid gastropods and the crustose calcareous alga, Neogoniolithon brassica-florida, which cements the gastropod shells and thus solidifying the reef edges. In the present study, we examined the pattern of distribution in the field and the environmental sensitivity (thermal tolerance, resilience to low {pH}, high light intensity and desiccation) of N. brassica-florida along the coasts of Sicily and Israel by means of chlorophyll fluorescence and total alkalinity measurements in situ and in the laboratory. Tidal regimes did not affect photosynthesis of N. brassica-florida but light intensity in the intertidal did. Sensitivity to increased light intensity was amplified by elevated temperature and reduced {pH}. Winter temperature above 16 degrees C caused a decrease in the photosynthetic performance of photo-system {II}. Similarly, a decrease in {pH} resulted in decreased maximum photosynthetic yield and electron transport rate. Calcification was significantly lower at {pH} 7.9 as compared with ambient (8.1) {pH}. In fact, dissolution at {pH} 7.9 at night was higher than net calcification during the day, suggesting that N. brassica-florida may not be able to contribute to reef accretion under the levels of seawater warming and ocean acidification projected by the end of this century.},

	abstract = {{ABSTRACT} Carbonate frameworks secreted by phototrophic organisms within the Arctic Circle are not well documented. Underwater surveys of the inner-shelf off Troms, northern Norway (70°N), reveal extended fixed algal build-ups which are fringed by rhodolith belts affected by storms. Reefal growth by coralline algae under temperature and light regimes of extreme seasonality is made possible because of a decoupling of carbon fixation during summer and utilization of stored carbon during the period of winter darkness. Although the annual growth of the framework constructing algae is comparatively low, the annual carbonate production rate is similar to subtropical-tropical counterparts because of a remarkably high standing stock. Early diagenetic alteration is restricted to intraparticle cementation processes which start in vivo. Bioerosional destruction is the dominant control on the preservation of high latitude build-ups. Preservation of Holocene autochthonous coralline algal biostromes is enhanced by rapid burial during storm events. Redeposition during storms is the most important process in forming a distinct sedimentary facies zonation.},

We cultured the articulated coralline alga Corallina sessilis Yendo at 380 ppmv (low) and 1000 ppmv (high) {CO}2 levels while exposing the alga to solar radiation treatments with or without {UVR}. The presence of {UVR} inhibited the growth, photosynthetic O-2 evolution and calcification rates by13\%, 6\% and 3\% in the low and by 47\%, 20\% and 8\% in the high {CO}2 concentrations, respectively, reflecting a synergistic effect of {CO}2 enrichment with {UVR}. {UVR} induced significant decline of {pH} in the {CO}2-enriched cultures. The contents of key photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll a and phycobiliproteins decreased, while {UV}-absorptivity increased under the high {pCO}(2)/low {pH} condition. Nevertheless, {UV}-induced inhibition of photosynthesis increased when the ratio of particulate inorganic carbon/particulate organic carbon decreased under the influence of {CO}2-acidified seawater, suggesting that the calcified layer played a {UV}-protective role. Both {UVA} and {UVB} negatively impacted photosynthesis and calcification, but the inhibition caused by {UVB} was about 2.5-2.6 times that caused by {UVA}. The results imply that coralline algae suffer from more damage caused by {UVB} as they calcify less and less with progressing ocean acidification.},

	abstract = {Macroalgae are the major habitat-forming organisms in many coastal temperate and subtropical marine systems. Although climate change has been identified as a major threat to the persistence of macroalgal beds, the combined effects of ocean warming and ocean acidification on algal performance are poorly understood. Here we investigate the effects of increased temperature and acidification on the growth, calcification and nutritional content of 6 common subtropical macroalgae; Sargassum linearifolium, Ulva sp., Amphiroa anceps, Corallina officinalis, Delisea pulchra and Laurencia decussata. Algae were reared in a factorial cross of 3 temperatures (23 degrees C [ambient], 26 degrees C and 28 degrees C) and 3 {pH} levels (8.1 [ambient], 7.8 and 7.6) for 2 wk. The highest (28 degrees C) temperature decreased the growth of all 6 macroalgal species, irrespective of the {pH} levels. In contrast, the effect of decreased {pH} on growth was variable. The growth of Ulva sp. and C. officinalis increased, L. decussata decreased, while the remaining 3 species were unaffected. Interestingly, the differential responses of macroalgae to ocean acidification were unrelated to whether or not a species was a calcifying alga, or their carbon-uptake mechanism - 2 processes that are predicted to be sensitive to decreased {pH}. The growth of the calcifying algae (C. officinalis and A. anceps) was not affected by reduced {pH} but calcification of these 2 algae was reduced when exposed to a combination of reduced {pH} and elevated temperature. The 3 species capable of uptake of bicarbonate, S. linearifolium, L. decussata and Ulva sp., displayed positive, negative and neutral changes in growth, respectively, in response to reduced {pH}. The C:N ratio for 5 of the 6 species was unaffected by either {pH} or temperature. The consistent and predictable negative effects of temperature on the growth and calcification of subtropical macroalgae suggests that this stressor poses a greater threat to the persistence of subtropical macroalgal populations than ocean acidification under ongoing and future climate change.},

Calcifying organisms are sensitive to elevated {CO}2 concentrations due to their calcium carbonate skeletons. In temperate rocky intertidal environments, calcifying and noncalcifying macroalgae make up diverse benthic photoautotrophic communities. These communities may change as calcifiers and noncalcifiers respond differently to rising {CO}2 concentrations. In order to test this hypothesis, we conducted an 86 d mesocosm experiment to investigate the physiological and competitive responses of calcifying and noncalcifying temperate marine macroalgae to 385, 665, and 1486 mu atm {CO}2. We focused on comparing 2 abundant red algae in the Northeast Atlantic: Corallina officinalis (calcifying) and Chondrus crispus (noncalcifying). We found an interactive effect of {CO}2 concentration and exposure time on growth rates of C. officinalis, and total protein and carbohydrate concentrations in both species. Photosynthetic rates did not show a strong response. Calcification in C. officinalis showed a parabolic response, while skeletal inorganic carbon decreased with increasing {CO}2. Community structure changed, as Chondrus crispus cover increased in all treatments, while C. officinalis cover decreased in both elevated-{CO}2 treatments. Photochemical parameters of other species are also presented. Our results suggest that {CO}2 will alter the competitive strengths of calcifying and noncalcifying temperate benthic macroalgae, resulting in different community structures, unless these species are able to adapt at a rate similar to or faster than the current rate of increasing sea-surface {CO}2 concentrations.},

	abstract = {Crustose coralline algae ({CCA}) are among the most sensitive marine taxa to the {pH} changes predicted with ocean acidification ({OA}). However, many {CCA} exist in habitats where diel cycles in {pH} can surpass near-future {OA} projections. The prevailing theory that natural variability increases the tolerance of calcifiers to {OA} has not been widely tested with tropical {CCA}. Here, we assess the response of the reef-building species Lithophyllum congestum to stable and variable {pH} treatments, including an ambient control (amb/stable). The amb/variable treatment simulated an ambient diel cycle in {pH} (7.65-7.95), {OA}/stable simulated constant low {pH} reflecting worst-case year 2100 predictions (7.7), and {OA}/variable combined diel cycling with lower mean {pH} (7.45-7.75). We monitored the effects of {pH} on total calcification rate and photophysiology (maximum quantum yield) over 16 weeks. To assess the potential for acclimatization, we also quantified calcification rates during the first (0-8 weeks), and second (8-16 weeks) halves of the experiment. Calcification rates were lower in all {pH} treatments relative to ambient controls and photophysiology was unaffected. At the end of the 16-week experiment, total calcification rates were similarly low in the amb/variable and {OA}/stable treatment (27-29\%), whereas rates declined by double in the {OA}/variable treatment (60\%). When comparing the first and second halves of the experiment, there was no acclimatization in stable treatments as calcification rates remained unchanged in both the amb/stable and {OA}/stable treatments. In contrast, calcification rates deteriorated between periods in the variable treatments: from a 16-47\% reduction in the amb/variable treatment to a 49-79\% reduction in the {OA}/variable treatment, relative to controls. Our findings provide compelling evidence that {pH} variability can heighten {CCA} sensitivity to reductions in {pH}. Moreover, the decline in calcification rate over time directly contrasts prevailing theory that variability inherently increases organismal tolerances to low {pH}, and suggests that mechanisms of tolerance may become limited with increasing time of exposure. The significant role of diel {pH} cycling in {CCA} responses to {OA} indicates that organisms in habitats with diel variability could respond more severely to rapid changes in ocean {pH} associated with {OA} than predicted by experiments conducted under static conditions.},

	abstract = {Anthropogenic {CO}2 emissions have exacerbated two environmental stressors, global climate warming and ocean acidification ({OA}), that have serious implications for marine ecosystems. Coral reefs are vulnerable to climate change yet few studies have explored the potential for interactive effects of warming temperature and {OA} on an important coral reef calcifier, crustose coralline algae ({CCA}). Coralline algae serve many important ecosystem functions on coral reefs and are one of the most sensitive organisms to ocean acidification. We investigated the effects of elevated {pCO}(2) and temperature on calcification of Hydrolithon onkodes, an important species of reef-building coralline algae, and the subsequent effects on susceptibility to grazing by sea urchins. H. onkodes was exposed to a fully factorial combination of {pCO}(2) (420, 530, 830 mu atm) and temperature (26, 29 degrees C) treatments, and calcification was measured by the change in buoyant weight after 21 days of treatment exposure. Temperature and {pCO}(2) had a significant interactive effect on net calcification of H. onkodes that was driven by the increased calcification response to moderately elevated {pCO}(2). We demonstrate that the {CCA} calcification response was variable and non-linear, and that there was a trend for highest calcification at ambient temperature. H. onkodes then was exposed to grazing by the sea urchin Echinothrix diadema, and grazing was quantified by the change in {CCA} buoyant weight from grazing trials. E. diadema removed 60\% more {CaCO}3 from H. onkodes grown at high temperature and high {pCO}(2) than at ambient temperature and low {pCO}(2). The increased susceptibility to grazing in the high {pCO}(2) treatment is among the first evidence indicating the potential for cascading effects of {OA} and temperature on coral reef organisms and their ecological interactions.

	abstract = {Ocean acidification ({OA}) has important implications for the persistence of coral reef ecosystems, due to potentially negative effects on biomineralization. Many coral reefs are dynamic with respect to carbonate chemistry, and experience fluctuations in {pCO}(2) that exceed {OA} projections for the near future. To understand the influence of dynamic {pCO}(2) on an important reef calcifier, we tested the response of the crustose coralline alga Porolithon onkodes to oscillating {pCO}(2). Individuals were exposed to ambient (400 microatm), high (660 microatm), or variable {pCO}(2) (oscillating between 400/660 microatm) treatments for 14 days. To explore the potential for coralline acclimatization, we collected individuals from low and high {pCO}(2) variability sites (upstream and downstream respectively) on a back reef characterized by unidirectional water flow in Moorea, French Polynesia. We quantified the effects of treatment on algal calcification by measuring the change in buoyant weight, and on algal metabolism by conducting sealed incubations to measure rates of photosynthesis and respiration. Net photosynthesis was higher in the ambient treatment than the variable treatment, regardless of habitat origin, and there was no effect on respiration or gross photosynthesis. Exposure to high {pCO}(2) decreased P. onkodes calcification by {\textgreater}70\%, regardless of the original habitat. In the variable treatment, corallines from the high variability habitat calcified 42\% more than corallines from the low variability habitat. The significance of the original habitat for the coralline calcification response to variable, high {pCO}(2) indicates that individuals existing in dynamic {pCO}(2) habitats may be acclimatized to {OA} within the scope of in situ variability. These results highlight the importance of accounting for natural {pCO}(2) variability in {OA} manipulations, and provide insight into the potential for plasticity in habitat and species-specific responses to changing ocean chemistry.},

	abstract = {Despite the heightened awareness of ocean acidification ({OA}) effects on marine organisms, few studies empirically juxtapose biological responses to {CO}2 manipulations across functionally distinct primary producers, particularly benthic algae. Algal responses to {OA} may vary because increasing {CO}2 has the potential to fertilize photosynthesis but impair biomineralization. Using a series of repeated experiments on Palmyra Atoll, simulated {OA} effects were tested across a suite of ecologically important coral reef algae, including five fleshy and six calcareous species. Growth, calcification and photophysiology were measured for each species independently and metrics were combined from each experiment using a meta-analysis to examine overall trends across functional groups categorized as fleshy, upright calcareous, and crustose coralline algae ({CCA}). The magnitude of the effect of {OA} on algal growth response varied by species, but the direction was consistent within functional groups. Exposure to {OA} conditions generally enhanced growth in fleshy macroalgae, reduced net calcification in upright calcareous algae, and caused net dissolution in {CCA}. Additionally, three of the five fleshy seaweeds tested became reproductive upon exposure to {OA} conditions. There was no consistent effect of {OA} on algal photophysiology. Our study provides experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that {OA} will reduce the ability of calcareous algae to biomineralize. Further, we show that {CO}2 enrichment either will stimulate population or somatic growth in some species of fleshy macroalgae. Thus, our results suggest that projected {OA} conditions may favor non-calcifying algae and influence the relative dominance of fleshy macroalgae on reefs, perpetuating or exacerbating existing shifts in reef community structure.},

	abstract = {Marine {pCO}2 enrichment via ocean acidification ({OA}), upwelling and release from carbon capture and storage ({CCS}) facilities is projected to have devastating impacts on marine biomineralisers and the services they provide. However, empirical studies using stable endpoint {pCO}2 concentrations find species exhibit variable biological and geochemical responses rather than the expected negative patterns. In addition, the carbonate chemistry of many marine systems is now being observed to be more variable than previously thought. To underpin more robust projections of future {OA} impacts on marine biomineralisers and their role in ecosystem service provision, we investigate coralline algal responses to realistically variable scenarios of marine {pCO}2 enrichment. Coralline algae are important in ecosystem function; providing habitats and nursery areas, hosting high biodiversity, stabilizing reef structures and contributing to the carbon cycle. Red coralline marine algae were exposed for 80 days to one of three {pH} treatments: (i) current {pH} (control); (ii) low {pH} (7.7) representing {OA} change; and (iii) an abrupt drop to low {pH} (7.7) representing the higher rates of {pH} change observed at natural vent systems, in areas of upwelling and during {CCS} releases. We demonstrate that red coralline algae respond differently to the rate and the magnitude of {pH} change induced by {pCO}2 enrichment. At low {pH}, coralline algae survived by increasing their calcification rates. However, when the change to low {pH} occurred at a fast rate we detected, using Raman spectroscopy, weaknesses in the calcite skeleton, with evidence of dissolution and molecular positional disorder. This suggests that, while coralline algae will continue to calcify, they may be structurally weakened, putting at risk the ecosystem services they provide. Notwithstanding evolutionary adaptation, the ability of coralline algae to cope with {OA} may thus be determined primarily by the rate, rather than magnitude, at which {pCO}2 enrichment occurs.},

To partition the direct effects of near future ocean acidification on juvenile {COTS} and indirect effects through changes in their {CCA} food, {COTS} were grown in three {pHT} levels (7.9, 7.8, 7.6) and fed {CCA} grown at similar {pH} levels.

Ocean acidification conditions decreased the C : N ratio and carbonate levels in the {CCA}. Bolstered growth in {COTS} may be driven by enhanced palatability, increased nutritive state and reduced defences of their {CCA} food.

	abstract = {Predicted ocean acidification and warming are likely to have major implications for marine organisms, especially marine calcifiers. However, little information is available on the response of marine benthic communities as a whole to predicted changes. Here, we experimentally examined the combined effects of temperature and partial pressure of carbon dioxide ({pCO}(2)/increases on the response of maerl bed assemblages, composed of living and dead thalli of the free-living coralline alga Lithothamnion corallioides, epiphytic fleshy algae, and grazer species. Two 3month experiments were performed in the winter and summer seasons in mesocosms with four different combinations of {pCO}(2) (ambient and high {pCO}(2)/and temperature (ambient and +3 degrees C). The response of maerl assemblages was assessed using metabolic measurements at the species and assemblage scales. This study suggests that seasonal variability represents an important driver influencing the magnitude and the direction of species and community response to climate change. Gross primary production and respiration of assemblages was enhanced by high {pCO}(2) conditions in the summer. This positive effect was attributed to the increase in epiphyte biomass, which benefited from higher {CO}2 concentrations for growth and primary production. Conversely, high {pCO}(2) drastically decreased the calcification rates in assemblages. This response can be attributed to the decline in calcification rates of living L. corallioides due to acidification and increased dissolution of dead L. corallioides. Future changes in {pCO}(2) and temperature are likely to promote the development of non-calcifying algae to the detriment of the engineer species L. corallioides. The development of fleshy algae may be modulated by the ability of grazers to regulate epiphyte growth. However, our results suggest that predicted changes will negatively affect the metabolism of grazers and potentially their ability to control epiphyte abundance. We show here that the effects of {pCO}(2) and temperature on maerl bed communities were weakened when these factors were combined. This underlines the importance of examining multifactorial approaches and community-level processes, which integrate species interactions, to better understand the impact of global change on marine ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Coralline algae are expected to be adversely impacted by ocean acidification and warming. Most research on these algae has involved experiments on isolated species, without considering species interactions, such as grazing. This myopic view is challenging because the impact of climate change on coralline algae will depend on the direct impacts on individual coralline species and the indirect effects of altered interactions with other species. Here, we tested the influence of grazing on the response of the coralline alga Lithothamnion corallioides to near-future ocean acidification and warming. Two three-month experiments were performed in the winter and summer seasons in mesocosms under crossed conditions of {pCO}(2) (ambient and high {pCO}(2)) and temperature (ambient and +3 degrees C) in the presence and absence of grazers. In the winter, L. corallioides photosynthesis decreased with rising temperature in the presence of grazers, while calcification increased. It is likely that increased calcification may act as a structural protection to prevent damage from grazing. However, increasing calcification rates in the presence of grazers may be detrimental to other physiological processes, such as photosynthesis. In the summer, L. corallioides primary production, respiration, and calcification were higher in the presence of grazers than in their absence. Light calcification rates were reduced under high {pCO}(2) in the presence of grazers only. Moreover, dark calcification rates were more adversely affected by {pCO}(2) increase in the presence of grazers. Through their feeding activity, grazers may alter the structural integrity of thalli and increase the sensitivity of coralline algae to ocean acidification. Our results indicate that both season and grazing play a key role in the response of L. corallioides to acidification and warming. Seasonal variations and species interactions are thus critical to consider to make ecologically relevant predictions of the effects of future environmental changes.},

	abstract = {Reef dwelling algae employ a variety of physical and chemical defenses against herbivory, and the response to wounding is extremely important in algal communities. Wound healing mechanisms in crustose coralline algae ({CCA}) are related to skeletal growth and net calcification rate. Ocean acidification ({OA}) is known to affect rates of net calcification in a number of calcifying organisms, including {CCA}. Reduced rates of net calcification in {CCA} are likely to alter wound healing, and thus affect the consequences of herbivore-{CCA} interactions on coral reefs. The response of the tropical {CCA} Porolithon onkodes to {OA} and artificial wounding was quantified in a 51-day laboratory experiment. Eight artificially wounded (cut to a mean depth of 182 mu m) and eight non-wounded samples of P. onkodes were randomly placed into each of four treatments (n = 64 samples total). Each treatment was maintained at a different {pCO}(2) level representative of either ambient conditions or end-of-the-century, predicted conditions ({IPCC}, 2014); 429.31 +/- 20.84 (ambient), 636.54 +/- 27.29 ({RCP}4.5), 827.33 +/- 38.51 ({RCP}6.0), and 1179.39 +/- 88.85 mu atm ({RCP}8.5; mean +/- standard error). Elevated {pCO}(2) significantly reduced rates of net calcification in both wounded and non-wounded samples of P. onkodes (slopes = -6.4 x 10(-4) and - 5.5 x 10(-4) mg cm(-2) d(-1) per mu atm {pCO}(2), respectively over 51 days). There also was a significant reduction in the rate of vertical regeneration of thallus tissue within the wounds as {pCO}(2) increased (slope = -1.5 x 10(-3) mu m d(-1) per mu atm {pCO}(2) over 51 days). This study provides evidence that elevated {pCO}(2) could reduce the ability of this important alga to recover from wounding. Because wounding by herbivores plays an important role in determining {CCA} community structure, we propose reduced wound healing as a mechanism by which {OA} might affect the structure and functional roles of {CCA} communities on coral reefs.},

Coralline algae were incubated in dark and clear bottles exposed to different irradiances. Net primary production reached 1.5{μmolCg}−1drywth−1 in August and was twice as high as in January–February. Dark respiration showed significant seasonal variations, being three-fold higher in summer. Maximum calcification varied from 0.6μmolg−1drywth−1 in summer 2004 to 0.4μmolg−1drywth−1 in winter 2005. According to P–E curves and the daily course of irradiance, estimated daily net production and calcification reached 131{μgCg}−1drywt and 970{μgCaCO}3g−1drywt in summer 2004, and 36{μgCg}−1drywt and 336{μgCaCO}3g−1drywt in winter 2005. The net primary production of natural L. corallioides populations in shallow waters was estimated at 10–600gCm−2y−1, depending on depth and algal biomass. The mean annual calcification of L. corallioides populations varied from 300 to 3000gCaCO3m−2. These results are similar to those reported for tropical coralline algae in terms of carbon and carbonate productivity. Therefore, L. corallioides can be considered as a key element of carbon and carbonate cycles in the shallow coastal waters where they live.},

Algae were maintained in aquaria during 1 year at near-ambient conditions of irradiance, at ambient or elevated temperature (+3 degrees C), and at ambient (ca. 400 muatm) or elevated {pCO}2 (ca. 700 muatm). Respiration, photosynthesis, and net calcification showed a strong seasonal pattern following the seasonal variations of temperature and irradiance, with higher rates in summer than in winter. Respiration was unaffected by {pCO}2 but showed a general trend of increase at elevated temperature at all seasons, except in summer under elevated {pCO}2. Conversely, photosynthesis was strongly affected by {pCO}2 with a decline under elevated {pCO}2 in summer, autumn, and winter. In particular, photosynthetic efficiency was reduced under elevated {pCO}2. Net calcification showed different responses depending on the season. In summer, net calcification increased with rising temperature under ambient {pCO}2 but decreased with rising temperature under elevated {pCO}2. Surprisingly, the highest rates in summer were found under elevated {pCO}2 and ambient temperature. In autumn, winter, and spring, net calcification exhibited a positive or no response at elevated temperature but was unaffected by {pCO}2. The rate of calcification of L. cabiochae was thus maintained or even enhanced under increased {pCO}2. However, there is likely a trade-off with other physiological processes. For example, photosynthesis declines in response to increased {pCO}2 under ambient irradiance. The present study reports only on the physiological response of healthy specimens to ocean warming and acidification, however, these environmental changes may affect the vulnerability of coralline algae to other stresses such as pathogens and necroses that can cause major dissolution, which would have critical consequence for the sustainability of coralligenous habitats and the budgets of carbon and calcium carbonate in coastal Mediterranean ecosystems.},

Algae were maintained in aquaria during 1 year at near-ambient conditions of irradiance, at ambient or elevated temperature (+3 degrees C) and at ambient [ca. 400 parts per million (ppm)] or elevated {pCO}(2) (ca. 700 ppm). Algal necroses appeared at the end of summer under elevated temperature first at 700 ppm (60\% of the thallus surface) and then at 400 ppm (30\%). The death of algae was observed only under elevated temperature and was two- to threefold higher under elevated {pCO}(2). During the first month of the experiment, net calcification was significantly reduced under elevated {pCO}(2). At the end of the summer period, net calcification decreased by 50\% when both temperature and {pCO}(2) were elevated while no effect was found under elevated temperature and elevated {pCO}(2) alone. In autumn and winter, net calcification in healthy algae increased with increasing temperature, independently of the {pCO}(2) level, while necroses and death in the algal population caused a net dissolution at elevated temperature and {pCO}(2). The dissolution of dead algal thalli was affected by elevated {pCO}(2), being two- to fourfold higher than under ambient {pCO}(2). These results suggest that net dissolution is likely to exceed net calcification in L. cabiochae by the end of this century.

	abstract = {Coralline algae are major calcifiers of significant ecological importance in marine habitats but are among the most sensitive calcifying organisms to ocean acidification. The elevated {pCO}(2) effects were examined in three coralline algal species living in contrasting habitats from intertidal to subtidal zones on the north-western coast of Brittany, France: (i) Corallina elongata, a branched alga found in tidal rock pools, (ii) Lithophyllum incrustans, a crustose coralline alga from the low intertidal zone, and (iii) Lithothamnion corallioides (maerl), a free-living form inhabiting the subtidal zone. Metabolic rates were assessed on specimens grown for one month at varying {pCO}(2): 380 (current {pCO}(2)), 550, 750 and 1000 mu atm (elevated {pCO}(2)). There was no {pCO}(2) effect on gross production in C. elongata and L. incrustans but L. incrustans respiration strongly increased with elevated {pCO}(2). L corallioides gross production slightly increased at 1000 mu atm, while respiration remained unaffected. Calcification rates decreased with {pCO}(2) in L. incrustans (both in the light and dark) and L. corallioides (only in the light), while C. elongata calcification was unaffected. This was consistent with the lower skeletal {mMg}/Ca ratio of C. elongata (0.17) relative to the two other species (0.20). L. incrustans had a higher occurrence of bleaching that increased with increasing {pCO}(2). {pCO}(2) could indirectly impact this coralline species physiology making them more sensitive to other stresses such as diseases or pathogens. These results underlined that the physiological response of coralline algae to near-future ocean acidification is species-specific and that species experiencing naturally strong {pH} variations were not necessarily more resistant to elevated {pCO}(2) than species from more stable environment.

	abstract = {Calcification in the marine environment is the basis for the accretion of carbonate in structures such as coral reefs, algal ridges and carbonate sands. Among the organisms responsible for such calcification are the Corallinaceae (Rhodophyta), recognised as major contributors to the process world-wide. Hydrolithon sp. is a coralline alga that often forms rhodoliths in the Western Indian Ocean. In Zanzibar, it is commonly found in shallow lagoons, where it often grows within seagrass beds and/or surrounded by green algae such as Ulva sp. Since seagrasses in Zanzibar have recently been shown to raise the {pH} of the surrounding seawater during the day, and since calcification rates are sensitive to {pH}, which changes the saturation state of calcium carbonate, we measured the effects of {pH} on photosynthetic and calcification rates of this alga. It was found that {pH} had significant effects on both calcification and photosynthesis. While increased {pH} enhanced calcification rates both in the light and in the dark at {pH} {\textgreater}8.6, photosynthetic rates decreased. On the other hand, an increase in dissolved {CO}2 concentration to similar to 26 mu mol kg(-1) (by bubbling with air containing 0.9 mbar {CO}2) caused a decrease in seawater {pH} which resulted in 20\% less calcification after 5 days of exposure, while enhancing photosynthetic rates by 13\%. The ecological implications of these findings is that photosynthetically driven changes in water chemistry by surrounding plants can affect calcification rates of coralline algae, as may future ocean acidification resulting from elevated atmospheric {CO}2.

	abstract = {Ocean acidification is a decrease in seawater {pH} and carbonate ion concentration due to increased uptake of atmospheric carbon dioxide by the world's oceans. This has major implications for many marine organisms, particularly the calcifiers. Crustose coralline algae ({CA}) are among the most sensitive calcifying organisms to ocean acidification. In contrast, filamentous turf algae, which compete with {CCA} for space on the substratum, could potentially benefit from high {pCO}(2) conditions, suggesting that the effects of filamentous turf on coralline algae may be amplified in a high {pCO}(2) environment. The effect of ocean acidification on the growth of coralline algae, however, has rarely been investigated in combination with ecological interactions such as competition with filamentous turfing algae. Here we tested the combined effects of ocean acidification and overgrowth by filamentous turf algae on {CCA} calcification, photosynthetic capacity and quantum yield of photosynthesis. We observed a positive effect of algal turfs on {CCA} calcification but a negative effect on photosynthesis in the high {pCO}(2) treatments, however, these effects were variable overtime. Our results have demonstrated the importance of investigating how inter-species interactions such as competition will complicate the impacts of ocean acidification. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A clear understanding of growth pattern and rate is required to interpret time-series proxy data. Variability in growth on multiple-axes of a single rhodolith has not been extensively studied. This investigation compares algal band counting and dating methods found in the literature, and has implications for detecting biases in branch selection for growth and geochemical analyses. Panamanian rhodoliths (Lithothamnion sp.) were collected at the Archipelago de Las Perlas, Gulf of Panama ({GOP}). Alizarin Red S ({ARS}) stain was used to study growth rates and banding patterns for 10 branched samples randomly selected for microcosm experiments over a 172-day period. {DNA} analysis was used to help determine the dominant species present in the sample group and reduce the possibility of inter-sample variation. Samples were overturned every 2weeks for a multi-axial growth test and were grown under ambient seawater conditions except for the addition of {LED} lighting. Growth post-{ARS} staining was measured along the long (A), intermediate (B), and short (C) axes. Bisected branches show banding correlated with growth rate while banding was highly variable within an individual and between individuals. Average growth band widths in both the pre- and post-{ARS} stained growth were approximately the same, suggesting that non-environmental factors, such as overturning or biological influences, can cause the formation of growth increments. Differences in growth pattern and rate suggest that careful inspection of growth formation is needed before pursuing rhodolith-based time series proxy research.},

Some of the inconsistencies found among {OA} experimental studies may be related to experimental exposure time and synergetic effects with other stressors. Here, we investigated the long-term (up to 20 months) effects of {OA} on the production and calcification of the most common maerl species of southern Portugal, Phymatolithon lusitanicum. Both the photosynthetic and calcification rates increased with {CO} 2 after the first 11 months of the experiment, whereas respiration slightly decreased with {CO} 2. After 20 months, the pattern was reversed. Acidified algae showed lower photosynthetic and calcification rates, as well as lower accumulated growth than control algae, suggesting that a metabolic threshold was exceeded. Our results indicate that long-term exposure to high {CO} 2 will decrease the resilience of Phymatolithon lusitanicum. Our results also show that shallow communities of these rhodoliths may be particularly at risk, while deeper rhodolith beds may become ocean acidification refuges for this biological community.},

In addition, the increasing frequency of extreme events, such as heat waves, threatens coastal ecosystems and may affect their capacity to fix blue carbon. The few studies where the simultaneous effects of both temperature and {CO}2 were investigated have revealed contradictory results. To assess the effect that high temperature spells can have on the maerl beds under {OA}, we tested the short-time effects of temperature and {CO}2 on the net photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification of the recently described species Phymatolithon lusitanicum, the most common maerl species of southern Portugal. Photosynthesis, calcification, and respiration increased with temperature, and the differences among treatments were enhanced under high {CO}2. We found that in the short term, the metabolic rates of Phymatolithon lusitanicum will increase with {CO}2 and temperature as will the coupling between calcification and photosynthesis. However, under high {CO}2, this coupling will favor photosynthesis over calcification, which, in the long term, can have a negative effect on the blue carbon fixing capacity of the maerl beds from southern Portugal.},

              Crustose coralline red algae ({CCA}) play a key role in the consolidation of many modern tropical coral reefs. It is unclear, however, if their function as reef consolidators was equally pronounced in the geological past. Using a comprehensive database on ancient reefs, we show a strong correlation between the presence of {CCA} and the formation of true coral reefs throughout the last 150 Ma. We investigated if repeated breakdowns in the potential capacity of {CCA} to spur reef development were associated with sea level, ocean temperature, {CO}

              concentration, {CCA} species diversity, and/or the evolution of major herbivore groups. Model results show that the correlation between the occurrence of {CCA} and the development of true coral reefs increased with {CCA} diversity and cooler ocean temperatures while the diversification of herbivores had a transient negative effect. The evolution of novel herbivore groups compromised the interaction between {CCA} and true reef growth at least three times in the investigated time interval. These crises have been overcome by morphological adaptations of {CCA}.},

	abstract = {Crustose coralline red algae ({CCA}) play a key role in the consolidation of many modern tropical coral reefs. It is unclear, however, if their function as reef consolidators was equally pronounced in the geological past. Using a comprehensive database on ancient reefs, we show a strong correlation between the presence of {CCA} and the formation of true coral reefs throughout the last 150 Ma. We investigated if repeated breakdowns in the potential capacity of {CCA} to spur reef development were associated with sea level, ocean temperature, {CO}2 concentration, {CCA} species diversity, and/or the evolution of major herbivore groups. Model results show that the correlation between the occurrence of {CCA} and the development of true coral reefs increased with {CCA} diversity and cooler ocean temperatures while the diversification of herbivores had a transient negative effect. The evolution of novel herbivore groups compromised the interaction between {CCA} and true reef growth at least three times in the investigated time interval. These crises have been overcome by morphological adaptations of {CCA}.},

	abstract = {Crustose coralline algae ({CCA}) are important ecosystem engineers and carbonate producers today and in the geological past. While there is an increasing number of publications on {CCA} every year, it is evident that there are many misunderstandings and inconsistencies in the assignment of {CCA} to taxonomic and functional groups. This is partly because {CCA} are treated by biologists, ecologists and palaeontologists as well as covered by studies published in journals ranging from geo- to biosciences, so that there is often a mixture of terminology used and differing scientific focus. In this review, a comprehensive overview is given on what is known about {CCA}, their functional traits and their roles in environments from the present and the past. In this context, some bridges are built between the commonly different viewpoints of ecologists and palaeontologists, including suggesting a common and straightforward terminology, highlighting and partially merging different taxonomic viewpoints as well as summarizing the most important functional traits of {CCA}. Ideally, future studies should seek to quantitatively analyse potential implications for {CCA} and their associated organisms under ongoing global change.},

	abstract = {The ongoing increase in anthropogenic carbon dioxide ({CO}2) emissions is changing the global marine environment and is causing warming and acidiﬁcation of the oceans. Reduction of {CO}2 to a sustainable level is required to avoid further marine change. Many studies investigate the potential of marine carbon sinks (e.g. seagrass) to mitigate anthropogenic emissions, however, information on storage by coralline algae and the beds they create is scant. Calcifying photosynthetic organisms, including coralline algae, can act as a {CO}2 sink via photosynthesis and {CaCO}3 dissolution and act as a {CO}2 source during respiration and {CaCO}3 production on short-term timescales. Longterm carbon storage potential might come from the accumulation of coralline algae deposits over geological timescales. Here, the carbon storage potential of coralline algae is assessed using meta-analysis of their global organic and inorganic carbon production and the processes involved in this metabolism. Net organic and inorganic production were estimated at 330 g C m−2 yr−1 and 900 g {CaCO}3 m−2 yr−1 respectively giving global organic/inorganic C production of 0.7/1.8 × 109 t C yr−1. Calcium carbonate production by free-living/crustose coralline algae ({CCA}) corresponded to a sediment accretion of 70/450 mm kyr−1. Using this potential carbon storage for coralline algae, the global production of free-living algae/{CCA} was 0.4/1.2 × 109 t C yr−1 suggesting a total potential carbon sink of 1.6 × 109 tonnes per year. Coralline algae therefore have production rates similar to mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses representing an as yet unquantiﬁed but signiﬁcant carbon store, however, further empirical investigations are needed to determine the dynamics and stability of that store.},

	abstract = {An accurate method for determining the growth rates of the skeleton of isolated branch tips (nubbins) of corals over intervals of less than 24 h is described. The skeletal weight of the coral was estimated from its buoyant weight in seawater whose density had been accurately determined. The coral tissues accounted for between 1 and 5\% of the total buoyant weight in Pocillopora verrucosa and Acropora humilis with differing relative tissue biomass. After correcting for tissue buoyant weight, predictions of skeletal weight were accurate to within 1\%. The method was used to estimate the growth of sample nubbins of Porites porites of similar diameter, in 2 m of water at Discovery Bay, Jamaica. Since growth of these branch tips is apical, growth rate could be expressed without correction for the size. The mean 24 h skeletal growth rate ranged between 40 and 47 mg. Differences could be measured between day-time and night-time growth, the day: night ratio being 3.7. The method also showed that P. porites virtually ceases calcification during the 4 to 5 d periods that it becomes enclosed in a mucus tunic. Nubbins of P. porites attached to the reef at different locations showed clear differences in growth rate with depth, and between clear and turbid water sites. The growth rate of nubbins was compared with that of branch tips of whole corals by measuring the linear extension after staining with Alizarin Red S. After 3 1/2 mo, the mean linear extension was 4.1 mm in each case, indicating that the growth rate of nubbins is the same as that of branch tips of the whole colony. It is suggested that this buoyant weighing technique will find applications in laboratory experiments with calcification mechanisms and as a bioassay on reefs exposed to environmental stress.},

	abstract = {Primary productivity of reef—building algae was studied by putting samples from the reef in a closed system and measuring oxygen exchange in the light and in the dark. Gross productivity determined for 32 samples in full sunlight had a mean value of 0.048 mg O2 cm—2 hr—1. Photosynthesis was found to increase with the logarithm of light intensity up to 1,000 ft—c and was constant between 1,000 and 8,000 ft—c. Rates of gas exchange in flowing water showed no correlation with water velocity but were greater than rates in still water. Daily patterns of photosynthesis were calculated for populations of calcareous algae living on the submarine faces of the windward sides of atolls. During most of the daylight hours light is probably not a limiting factor for photosynthesis in these populations. Calculated productivity of various calcareous algal zones indicates that these do not contribute significantly to overall reef production on atolls of the northern Marshall Islands. Island reefs are less productive than previously studied inter—island reefs.},
