Based on recent geochronological and biostratigraphic studies of the fossil-bearing deposits, a preliminary temporal framework has been established and suggests that the Jehol Biota had lasted for at least 11 Ma during the late Early Cretaceous (131–120 Ma). The development of the Jehol Biota can be divided into three major phases, with the most significant biological radiations occurring in the second phase between the Barremian and Aptian (approximately 125 Ma). Thanks to a diverse forest environment, major vertebrate groups, i.e. pterosaurs, dinosaurs, birds and mammals, in the Jehol Biota are characterized by a remarkably high percentage of arboreal and herbivorous forms. In addition to strong phylogenetic and morphological differentiation and high taxonomic diversity, the Jehol Biota is also characterized by significant dietary differentiation and biological interactions, i.e. competition and co-evolution between various animal groups, in an environment shaped by tectonic activities and palaeoclimatic changes both at a global and local scale.

Graywacke has the longer, if not more significant (albeit confused), history. For 100 years in Germany and 50 in Britain, before development by Sorby of thin section petrography, graywacke was used as a purely hand specimen term based chiefly upon texture. It seems pointless to change this emphasis for an important, large, texturally-similar yet compositlonally-varied rock clan. Modal analysis and interpretation of immature sandstones presents many problems, especially that of matrix which is increasingly attacked as a classificatory parameter, chiefly of maturity. But it matters not how or when conspicuous matrix of graywackes formed for it to be useful for descriptive "coarse" separation of pure (arenite) and impure (wacke) sandstones; genesis of fine material must be interpreted in any sand, recent or ancient. Finer subdivision can be made on a compositional basis following flexible schemes such as Gilbert's. Sedimentary structures, tectonics, provenance, depositlonal process and environment should be avoided in petrographic classification. If textural and compositional maturity be accepted as the prime guides in classification, then purely quantitative placing of a rock within each maturity spectrum could replace all troublesome varietal names.</abstract><remote-database-name>DOI.org (Crossref)</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://pubs.geoscienceworld.org/jsedres/article/34/3/625-632/95753</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/I22SDK5D/R.

It has been proposed that the filamentous integumental appendages on several theropod dinosaurs are primitive feathers2,3,4,5,6; but the homology between these filamentous structures and feathers has been disputed7,8,9, and two taxa with true feathers (Caudipteryx and Protarchaeopteryx) have been proposed to be flightless birds8,10. Confirmation of the theropod origin of feathers requires documentation of unambiguously feather-like structures in a clearly non-avian theropod. Here we describe our observations of the filamentous integumental appendages of the basal dromaeosaurid dinosaur Sinornithosaurus millenii, which indicate that they are compound structures composed of multiple filaments. Furthermore, these appendages exhibit two types of branching structure that are unique to avian feathers: filaments joined in a basal tuft, and filaments joined at their bases in series along a central filament. Combined with the independent phylogenetic evidence supporting the theropod ancestry of birds11,12,13, these observations strongly corroborate the hypothesis that the integumental appendages of Sinornithosaurus are homologous with avian feathers. The plesiomorphic feathers of Sinornithosaurus also conform to the predictions of an independent, developmental model of the evolutionary origin of feathers14.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/35065589</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/NEVZM7AS/Xu et al. - 2001 - Branched integumental structures in Sinornithosaur.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-04-16 14:03:06</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><titles><title>Wayback Machine</title></titles><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-09-24</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>https://web.archive.org/web/20140924045019/http://69.167.155.165/content/pages/2601001/2601001.ch22.pdf</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/PTQ5J5CW/2014 - Wayback Machine.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-04-16 11:32:52</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sereno, Paul C.</author><author>Shichin, Chao</author><author>Zhengwu, Cheng</author><author>Chenggang, Rao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title><style face="italic">Psittacosaurus meileyingensis</style><style face="normal"> (Ornithischia: Ceratopsia), a new psittacosaur from the Lower Cretaceous of northeastern China</style></title><secondary-title>Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</secondary-title><short-title><style face="italic">Psittacosaurus meileyingensis</style><style face="normal"> (Ornithischia</style></short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</full-title><abbr-1>Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>366-377</pages><volume>8</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1988</year><pub-dates><date>1988-12-14</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0272-4634, 1937-2809</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/02724634.1988.10011725</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>DOI.org (Crossref)</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/02724634.1988.10011725</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2024-04-16 11:19:56</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ji, Qiang</author><author>Ji, Shu’an</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>On the Discovery of the earliest fossil bird in China (Sinosauropteryx gen. nov.) and the origin of birds</title></titles><dates/><remote-database-name>Zotero</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/3BIYSE3F/Ji und Ji - On the Discovery of the earliest fossil bird in Ch.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hou, Lian-hai</author><author>Zhou, Zhonghe</author><author>Martin, Larry D.</author><author>Feduccia, Alan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A beaked bird from the Jurassic of China</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>616-618</pages><volume>377</volume><number>6550</number><issue>6550</issue><keywords><keyword>Humanities and Social Sciences</keyword><keyword>multidisciplinary</keyword><keyword>Science</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1995</year><pub-dates><date>1995-10</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1476-4687</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/377616a0</electronic-resource-num><abstract>DISCOVERY of avian remains close to the age of Archaeopteryx in the Liaoning Province of northeastern China provides the earliest evidence for a beaked, edentulous bird. The associated wing skeleton retains the primitive pattern found in Archaeopteryx, including a manus with unfused carpal elements and long digits. Two leg skeletons from the same site also show an Archaeopteryxlevel of morphology, and provide the earliest indisputable evidence for a covering of body contour feathers. These specimens provide evidence for either an undiscovered pre-Archaeopteryx or a rapid, post-Archaeopteryxevolution in birds. As the first Jurassic birds to be described from outside Germany, they show that birds with long fingers terminating in large recurved claws were widely distributed. They are not found in the Early Cretaceous sediments of the same region, where there is a diverse assemblage of more advanced flying birds with smaller fingers and claws. The postcran-ial structure of Archaeopteryx andConfuciusornis seems to be adapted for climbing tree trunks and may have disappeared near the end of the Jurassic.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/377616a0</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/YC2AFIRX/Hou et al. - 1995 - A beaked bird from the Jurassic of China.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-04-16 10:52:16</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qiang, Ji</author><author>Currie, Philip J.</author><author>Norell, Mark A.</author><author>Shu-An, Ji</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Two feathered dinosaurs from northeastern China</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title><abbr-1>Nature</abbr-1></periodical><pages>753-761</pages><volume>393</volume><number>6687</number><issue>6687</issue><dates><year>1998</year><pub-dates><date>6/1998</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0028-0836, 1476-4687</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/31635</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>DOI.org (Crossref)</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/31635</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2024-04-16 10:28:38</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ji, Qiang</author><author>Luo, Zhe-Xi</author><author>Yuan, Chong-Xi</author><author>Wible, John R</author><author>Zhang, Jian-Ping</author><author>Georgi, Justin A</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The earliest known eutherian mammal</title></titles><volume>416</volume><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><remote-database-name>Zotero</remote-database-name><language>en</language></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ji, Qiang</author><author>Ji, Shu’an</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Chinese archaeopterygian, Protarchaeopteryx gen. nov.</title></titles><dates/><remote-database-name>Zotero</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/7FKHMTWK/Ji und Ji - A Chinese archaeopterygian, Protarchaeopteryx gen..pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Shu'an, Ji</author><author>Chunling, Gao</author><author>Jinyuan, Liu</author><author>Qingjin, Meng</author><author>Qiang, Ji</author></authors></contributors><titles><title><style face="normal">New Material of </style><style face="italic">Sinosauropteryx</style><style face="normal"> (Theropoda: Compsognathidae) from Western Liaoning, China</style></title><secondary-title>Acta Geologica Sinica - English Edition</secondary-title><short-title><style face="normal">New Material of </style><style face="italic">Sinosauropteryx</style><style face="normal"> (Theropoda</style></short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Geologica Sinica - English Edition</full-title><abbr-1>Acta Geologica Sinica (Eng)</abbr-1></periodical><pages>177-182</pages><volume>81</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>04/2007</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1000-9515, 1755-6724</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1755-6724.2007.tb00942.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>An incomplete specimen of Sinosauropteryx prima collected from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Forma tion of the Dawangzhangzi area in Lingyuan, western Liaoning is depicted.

A detailed investigation from the Upper Turonian Danubian Cretaceous Group (southern Germany) links authigenic marine glaucony precipitation (Großberg Formation) to the intense chemical weathering in the catchment of a supplying river system (Seugast Member, Roding Formation). Nine glauconitic facies types within the Großberg Formation reflect a mixed shallow-marine depositional environment with land-derived siliciclastics, marine-carbonates and authigenic glaucony. X-ray diffraction analyses confirm these authigenic green grains and matrix as glauconitic minerals. The very high values of the modified chemical index of alteration (mean CIX between 86 and 92) demonstrate that the catchment area of the Seugast River was deeply chemically weathered and leached. In comparison to the hydrochemistry of modern tropical streams, massive Late Cretaceous nearshore glaucony formation was promoted by the riverine flux from the deeply chemically weathered, wet-continents amply supplying essential elements (Fe, Si, K and Al), fuelling shallow-marine glauconitization. The sequence stratigraphic calibration of the shallow-marine to continental transect of the Großberg Formation and the Seugast Member, corresponding to the Late Turonian depositional sequence DS Tu 5, further demonstrates that Late Cretaceous glaucony formation was a fast process (&lt;500 kyr).&#xD;Supplementary material: Table S1 provides contents of total carbon (TC), total inorganic carbon (TIC), total organic carbon (TOC), major elements and Zr as well as element/Al ratios, calculated excess K (Kxs), silicate K (Ksil or K2Osil), molar element oxides and CIX values, and is available at https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.c.6297404</abstract><remote-database-name>lyellcollection.org (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.lyellcollection.org/doi/full/10.1144/jgs2022-098</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/X54M6FBW/Bansal et al. - 2023 - Enhanced chemical weathering of the continents pro.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-05-27 07:10:07</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Scheiblhofer, Esther</author><author>Moser, Ulrike</author><author>Lӧhr, Stefan</author><author>Wilmsen, Markus</author><author>Farkaš, Juraj</author><author>Gallhofer, Daniela</author><author>Bäckström, Alice Matsdotter</author><author>Zack, Thomas</author><author>Baldermann, Andre</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Revisiting Glauconite Geochronology: Lessons Learned from In Situ Radiometric Dating of a Glauconite-Rich Cretaceous Shelfal Sequence</title><secondary-title>Minerals</secondary-title><short-title>Revisiting Glauconite Geochronology</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Minerals</full-title></periodical><pages>818</pages><volume>12</volume><number>7</number><issue>7</issue><keywords><keyword>diagenesis</keyword><keyword>glauconite</keyword><keyword>illitization</keyword><keyword>in situ Rb-Sr geochronology</keyword><keyword>LA-ICP-MS/MS</keyword><keyword>radiometric dating</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022/7</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2075-163X</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.3390/min12070818</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The scarcity of well-preserved and directly dateable sedimentary sequences is a major impediment to inferring the Earth’s paleo-environmental evolution. The authigenic mineral glauconite can potentially provide absolute stratigraphic ages for sedimentary sequences and constraints on paleo-depositional conditions. This requires improved approaches for measuring and interpreting glauconite formation ages. Here, glauconite from a Cretaceous shelfal sequence (Langenstein, northern Germany) was characterized using petrographical, geochemical (EMP), andmineralogical (XRD) screening methods before in situ Rb-Sr dating via LA-ICP-MS/MS. The obtained glauconite ages (~101 to 97 Ma) partly overlap with the depositional age of the Langenstein sequence (±3 Ma), but without the expected stratigraphic age progression, which we attribute to detrital and diagenetic illitic phase impurities inside the glauconites. Using a novel age deconvolution approach, which combines the new Rb-Sr dataset with published K-Ar ages, we recalculate the glauconite bulk ages to obtain stratigraphically significant ‘pure’ glauconite ages (~100 to 96 Ma). Thus, our results show that pristine ages can be preserved in mineralogically complex glauconite grains even under burial diagenetic conditions (T &lt; 65 °C; &lt;1500 m depth), confirming that glauconite could be a suitable archive for paleo-environmental reconstructions and direct sediment dating.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.mdpi.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.mdpi.com/2075-163X/12/7/818</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/GEG8JA3S/Scheiblhofer et al. - 2022 - Revisiting Glauconite Geochronology Lessons Learn.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-05-27 07:16:05</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Voigt, Thomas</author><author>Eynatten, Hilmar von</author><author>Franzke, Hans-Joachim</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Late Cretaceous unconformities in the Subhercynian Cretaceous Basin (Germany)</title><secondary-title>Acta Geologica Polonica</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Acta Geologica Polonica</full-title></periodical><pages>673-694</pages><volume>54</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Central Europe</keyword><keyword>Harznordrand Thrust</keyword><keyword>Intraplate Deformation</keyword><keyword>Subhercynian Cretaceous Basin</keyword><keyword>Unconformities</keyword><keyword>Upper Cretaceous</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004-12-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>001-5709</isbn><abstract>In the Subhercynian Cretaceous Basin, six Upper Cretaceous angular unconformities can be observed. The first unconformity, at the base of the Cenomanian transgressive deposits, is not related to the development of the basin. While the second (Lower to Middle Coniacian) unconformity is almost limited to the northern basin margin, four unconformities are developed at the Harznordrand Thrust and span the short period from the Middle Santonian to the late Early Campanian (about 3 Ma). The intra-Coniacian unconformity at the northern basin margin proves tilting of the basin floor to the south-east and is possibly related to the development of the thrust too. The Santonian to Campanian unconformities at the Harznordrand Thrust reflect the formation of a continuously growing fault-propagation fold. Deposition above unconformities occurred when the rate of eustatic sea-level rise exceeded thrusting rate. Transgressions occurred in the earliest Middle Santonian, in the Late Santonian (intra-Marsupites Zone), in the earliest Campanian (granulataquadrata Zone) and in the late Early Campanian (Offaster pilula Zone). The ages of unconformities correlate well with the transgressive pulses proved in Western and Middle Europe and are not related to discrete deformational events.</abstract><remote-database-name>geojournals.pgi.gov.pl</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://geojournals.pgi.gov.pl/agp/article/view/10307</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/HY7GD85A/Voigt et al. - 2004 - Late Cretaceous unconformities in the Subhercynian.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-05-27 07:17:15</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilmsen, Markus</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sequence stratigraphy and palaeoceanography of the Cenomanian Stage in northern Germany</title><secondary-title>Cretaceous Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cretaceous Research</full-title><abbr-1>Cretaceous Research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>525-568</pages><volume>24</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><keywords><keyword>Bioevents</keyword><keyword>Cenomanian</keyword><keyword>Cretaceous</keyword><keyword>Graphic correlation</keyword><keyword>High-frequency cycles</keyword><keyword>Nearshore-to-outer shelf</keyword><keyword>Palaeoceanography</keyword><keyword>Sequence stratigraphy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003-10-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0195-6671</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/S0195-6671(03)00069-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The sequence stratigraphic and sedimentologic analysis of a 180-km nearshore (SSE) to outer shelf (NNW) transect shows the pulsatory nature of the ‘Cenomanian transgression’ in northern Germany. Five complete and the lower part of a sixth third-order depositional sequence can be recognized: DS Ce I and DS Ce II (Mantelliceras mantelli Zone); DS Ce III (Mantelliceras dixoni Zone; DS Ce IV (Cunningtoniceras inerme to lower Acanthoceras jukesbrownei Zone); DS Ce V [Acanthoceras jukesbrownei Zone to Calycoceras (P.) guerangeri Zone]; DS Ce VI (Metoicoceras geslinianum Zone to lower Turonian). In inner and mid-shelf settings, sequence boundaries are mostly represented by stratigraphic gaps. A major sea-level fall occurred at the Early/Middle Cenomanian transition (sequence boundary SB Ce III). Maximum transgression during the Cenomanian is indicated by the deposition of homogeneous pelagic sediments of the ‘Poor rhotomagense Limestones’ (Late Cenomanian sequence DS Ce V). Graphic correlation of the sections investigated with a composite standard suggests that the inner and middle shelf sections were strongly controlled by available accommodation space during the Early and Middle Cenomanian. From the late Middle Cenomanian, non-accommodation controlled deposition of the ‘Poor rhotomagense Limestones’ occurred across the whole of the transect. Apart from the third-order depositional sequences, a hierarchy of stacked higher frequency (fourth- to sixth-order) cycles can be recognized. The basal elements are sixth-order cycles, represented by dm- to metre-scale marl-limestone ‘precession couplets’. Fifth-order cycles are represented by bundles of four to six couplets separated by dark marker marls, inferred to record the ca.100ky short eccentricity cycle. Fourth-order cycles are sets of four (three to five) fifth-order cycles. Their boundaries are significant erosion surfaces associated with subordinate sea-level fall, occasionally coinciding with third-order sequence boundaries. Most of the ‘classic’ Cenomanian bioevents can be accommodated into the sequence stratigraphic framework. Three main types of bioevents are recognized: ‘onlapping bioevents’ at the transgressive surface or in the early transgressive systems tract, ‘maximum flooding bioevents’, and ‘late highstand bioevents’. Onlapping and late highstand bioevents developed mainly either in response to sedimentologic and taphonomic processes such as winnowing and condensation, or owing to faunal migration during transgression. Maximum flooding bioevents are related to blooms of specialist taxa adapted to low food supplies and low-energy conditions. Two contrasting sedimentary systems can be recognized based on the nature of the dominant planktic carbonate component: an Early to early Middle Cenomanian ‘calcisphere system’ (‘Pläner’), characterized by high CaCO3accumulation rates (up to 80m/my), a relatively high input of terrigenous material, and dense macroinvertebrate faunal communities; and a late Middle and Late Cenomanian ‘coccolith system’ (‘Poor rhotomagense Limestones’), characterized by low CaCO3accumulation rates (13–18m/my), low terrigenous input, and impoverished benthic communities. The ‘calcisphere system’ is interpreted to reflect eu-/mesotrophic middle shelf ‘green’ water masses with high primary productivity and high food supplies supporting a rich suspension- and deposit-feeding benthos. The ‘Poor rhotomagense Limestones’ document deposition from a low-productivity, oligotrophic outer shelf water mass (oceanic ‘blue water’). The change between the two systems was caused by the Middle Cenomanian transgression, associated with the breakdown of shelf-front systems and the onlap of stratified, ‘oceanic’ water masses. The strongly reduced surface water productivity of the oligotrophic ‘coccolith system’ resulted in the disappearance of dense benthic communities during the late Middle and Late Cenomanian.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195667103000697</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/5RPWM9FC/S0195667103000697.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-05-27 07:17:58</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wilmsen, M.</author><author>Niebuhr, B.</author><author>Hiss, M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Cenomanian of northern Germany: facies analysis of a transgressive biosedimentary system</title><secondary-title>Facies</secondary-title><short-title>The Cenomanian of northern Germany</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Facies</full-title><abbr-1>Facies</abbr-1></periodical><pages>242-263</pages><volume>51</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Cenomanian</keyword><keyword>Cretaceous</keyword><keyword>Palaeoceanography</keyword><keyword>Facies analysis</keyword><keyword>Nearshore-to-open shelf</keyword><keyword>Northern Germany</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2005</year><pub-dates><date>2005-11-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1612-4820</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10347-005-0058-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A facies analysis of the epicontinental marine Cenomanian sediments of northern Germany shows the presence of 17 facies types (FTs, including several subtypes) which can be assigned to three facies associations: 1) an inner shelf facies association (FT 1–8) with high amounts of terrigenous material and/or high-energy depositional features, 2) a middle shelf facies association (FT 9–15) of predominantly calcareous sediments with moderate amounts of generally fine siliciclastics, and 3) an outer shelf facies association (FT 16–17) of low-energy, fine-grained, pure limestones. These three facies associations roughly correspond to the well-known lithological units of the Cenomanian of northern Germany, i.e., the Essen Greensand/Cenomanian Marls complex, the Pläner Limestones, and the Poor rhotomagense Limestones. The sediments were deposited on a northward-dipping homoclinal ramp with more-or-less shoreline-parallel facies belts. The sediment composition on this ramp-like shelf was a function of the varying importance of three different sediment sources: 1) terrigenous input from the south (Rhenobohemia), generally fining/decreasing in a proximal–distal (i.e., S–N) direction; 2) production of skeletal grains, mainly by macrobenthic organisms; and 3) settling of planktic carbonate (mainly calcispheres and calcareous nannofossils). In response to decreasing water energy with increasing water depth, the seaward decreasing terrigenous influence, and increasing planktic carbonate production, increasingly finer and more calcareous sediments were deposited in a proximal–distal transect. This rather straightforward picture was slightly modified by highest carbonate accumulation rates (planktic and benthic) on the middle shelf, forming a mid-shelf depocenter (fossiliferous, calcisphere-rich Pläner Limestones). Time-transgressive, southward-directed onlap of this biosedimentary system during the Cenomanian caused a significant retreat of the coastline towards the south and a retrogradational stacking of facies belts, explaining the broadly similar facies development and lithology of Cenomanian successions across northern Germany. The boundaries of the lithological units, however, tend to be considerably diachronous in a distal–proximal transect. In the late Middle and early Late Cenomanian, a final drowning and facies levelling (“oceanization”) is indicated by the widespread deposition of uniform calcareous nannofossil mudstones (Poor rhotomagense Limestones).</abstract><remote-database-name>Springer Link</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s10347-005-0058-5</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/RC4Y63RW/Wilmsen et al. - 2005 - The Cenomanian of northern Germany facies analysi.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-05-27 07:18:53</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chang, Su-chin</author><author>Zhang, Haichun</author><author>Renne, Paul R</author><author>Fang, Yan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High-precision 40Ar/39Ar age for the Jehol Biota</title><secondary-title>Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology</full-title><abbr-1>Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>94-104</pages><volume>280</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Jehol Biota</keyword><keyword>Cretaceous</keyword><keyword>Ar/Ar geochronology</keyword><keyword>Jiufotang Formation</keyword><keyword>Tuchengzi Formation</keyword><keyword>Yixian Formation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009-09-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0031-0182</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.palaeo.2009.06.021</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abundant fossils of the terrestrial Jehol Biota, including plants, insects, dinosaurs, birds, mammals and freshwater invertebrates, were discovered from the Yixian Formation and the overlying Jiufotang Formation in Inner Mongolia, Hebei Province and Liaoning Province, northeastern China. Because of the exceptional preservation of fossils, the Jehol Biota is one of the most important Mesozoic lagerstätten and is referred to as a “Mesozoic Pompeii”. The Jehol Biota has provided a rare opportunity to address questions about the origin of birds, the evolution of feathers and flight, the early diversification of angiosperms and the timing of placental mammal radiation. Six tuff samples and two basalt samples collected from the Tuchengzi, the Yixian and the Jiufotang formations near the classic outcrops in western Liaoning, NE China yielded high-precision 40Ar/39Ar ages. We obtain an age of 129.7±0.5Ma for a basaltic lava from the bottom of the Yixian Formation and an age of 122.1±0.3Ma for a tuff from the lowermost part of the overlying Jiufotang Formation. Our age results provide an age calibration of the whole Yixian Formation and show that the whole formation was deposited entirely within Early Cretaceous time over an interval of ~7Ma.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S003101820900217X</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/GBSPYJKM/S003101820900217X.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-10 20:29:12</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><titles><title>Bachelor Size Biases 1</title><secondary-title>Google Docs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Google Docs</full-title></periodical><dates/><abstract>Friedrich-Alexander-Universität Erlangen-Nürnberg Naturwissenschaftliche Fakultät   Size biases in the vertebrate fauna of the Jehol Biota (Early Cretaceous, China)  Bachelorarbeit  Vorgelegt von Katrin Eckardt aus Paläobiologie  Betreuer/in: Emma Dunne Bearbeitungszeit: 01.04.2024 - 19.06.2...</abstract><language>de</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://docs.google.com/document/d/1s_dqIrwm_UiMf1JTzjbrvacDhRTRJGouuGLjPdngCX4/edit?usp=drive_web&amp;ouid=108608560773347033100&amp;usp=embed_facebook</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/6MXCUGH9/edit.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-10 20:31:35</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Zhonghe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The origin and early evolution of birds: discoveries, disputes, and perspectives from fossil evidence</title><secondary-title>Naturwissenschaften</secondary-title><short-title>The origin and early evolution of birds</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Naturwissenschaften</full-title><abbr-1>Naturwissenschaften</abbr-1></periodical><pages>455-471</pages><volume>91</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>Early Cretaceous</keyword><keyword>Yixian Formation</keyword><keyword>Early Bird</keyword><keyword>Modern Bird</keyword><keyword>Theropod Dinosaur</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>2004-10-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1432-1904</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00114-004-0570-4</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The study of the origin and early evolution of birds has never produced as much excitement and public attention as in the past decade. Well preserved and abundant new fossils of birds and dinosaurs have provided unprecedented new evidence on the dinosaurian origin of birds, the arboreal origin of avian flight, and the origin of feathers prior to flapping flight. The Mesozoic avian assemblage mainly comprises two major lineages: the prevalent extinct group Enantiornithes, and the Ornithurae, which gave rise to all modern birds, as well as several more basal taxa. Cretaceous birds radiated into various paleoecological niches that included fish- and seed-eating. Significant size and morphological differences and variation in flight capabilities, ranging from gliding to powerful flight among early birds, highlight the diversification of birds in the Early Cretaceous. There is little evidence, however, to support a Mesozoic origin of modern avian groups. Controversy and debate, nevertheless, surround many of these findings, and more details are needed to give a better appreciation of the significance of these new discoveries.</abstract><remote-database-name>Springer Link</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s00114-004-0570-4</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-10 20:49:22</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><titles><title>An exceptionally preserved Lower Cretaceous ecosystem | Nature</title></titles><dates/><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nature01420</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/5EK9X5R6/nature01420.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-13 19:31:14</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Zhonghe</author><author>Barrett, Paul M.</author><author>Hilton, Jason</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An exceptionally preserved Lower Cretaceous ecosystem</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>807-814</pages><volume>421</volume><number>6925</number><issue>6925</issue><keywords><keyword>Humanities and Social Sciences</keyword><keyword>multidisciplinary</keyword><keyword>Science</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2003</year><pub-dates><date>2003-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1476-4687</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nature01420</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fieldwork in the Early Cretaceous Jehol Group, northeastern China has revealed a plethora of extraordinarily well-preserved fossils that are shaping some of the most contentious debates in palaeontology and evolutionary biology.

It is rich in volcanic composition and consists of upper and lower grey-black shale, basal sandy conglomerate, top tuffaceous sandstone, middle massive silty mudstone and siltstone, as well as andesite, with a thickness of 28-95 m. The Jianshangou Bed is famous all over the world for its bearing early birds, angiosperms and feathered dinosaurs, and it also yields bivalves, gastropods, conchostracans, ostracods, shrimps, insects, fish, amphibians, primitive mammals and other reptiles. These fossils are typical representatives of the Late Mesozoic Jehol Biota from eastern Asia. The Chaomidianzi and Sihetun formations, proposed in recent years, are regarded as the junior synonyms of the Jianshangou Bed. The Jehol Biota is endemic to eastern Asia, however, it has a large geographic distribution, more than half of the European territory. Many species of the biota have close relationships with the late Jurassic European counterparts, e.g. both Confuciusornis and Archaeopteryx are primitive birds, Sinosauropteryx has a similar skeleton construction with Compsognathus, the ostracode assemblage from the Jianshangou Bed is close to that from the Purbeck Bed in England, and Aeschnidium occurs in both the Jianshangou Bed and Solnhofen of Germany. Based on the biostratigraphic correlation, the Jianshangou Bed is more probably late Tithonian in age. The latest zircon U-Pb dating of the Jianshangou Bed gives 125.2 Ma, and is close to the feldspar Ar/Ar dating of 124.6 Ma. A glauconite dating of 125 Ma was once got from England near the J/K boundary within the Purbeck Bed, so it is still problematic to place the J/K boundary at 130, 135, 137, 142 or 145.5 Ma in the International Stratigraphic Charts.</abstract><remote-database-name>Springer Link</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1360/04yd0038</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-13 19:37:14</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhonghe, Zhou</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Evolutionary radiation of the Jehol Biota: chronological and ecological perspectives</title><secondary-title>Geological Journal</secondary-title><short-title>Evolutionary radiation of the Jehol Biota</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Geological Journal</full-title></periodical><pages>377-393</pages><volume>41</volume><number>3-4</number><issue>3-4</issue><keywords><keyword>chronology</keyword><keyword>diet</keyword><keyword>Early Cretaceous</keyword><keyword>ecology</keyword><keyword>habitat</keyword><keyword>Jehol Biota</keyword><keyword>radiation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1099-1034</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/gj.1045</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Jehol Biota, preserved in the lacustrine sediments of Liaoning Province, northeast China, has provided a new window for understanding Early Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystems. Based on recent geochronological and biostratigraphic studies of the fossil-bearing deposits, a preliminary temporal framework has been established and suggests that the Jehol Biota had lasted for at least 11 Ma during the late Early Cretaceous (131–120 Ma). The development of the Jehol Biota can be divided into three major phases, with the most significant biological radiations occurring in the second phase between the Barremian and Aptian (approximately 125 Ma). Thanks to a diverse forest environment, major vertebrate groups, i.e. pterosaurs, dinosaurs, birds and mammals, in the Jehol Biota are characterized by a remarkably high percentage of arboreal and herbivorous forms. In addition to strong phylogenetic and morphological differentiation and high taxonomic diversity, the Jehol Biota is also characterized by significant dietary differentiation and biological interactions, i.e. competition and co-evolution between various animal groups, in an environment shaped by tectonic activities and palaeoclimatic changes both at a global and local scale.

Freshwater and terrestrial fossils of the biota usually occur together within some horizons and have been interpreted as deposits of mass mortality events. The nature of the events and the mechanisms behind the exceptional preservation of the fossils, however, are poorly understood. Here, after examining and analysing sediments and residual fossils from several key horizons, we postulate that the causal events were mainly phreatomagmatic eruptions. Pyroclastic density currents were probably responsible for the major causalities and for transporting the bulk of the terrestrial vertebrates from different habitats, such as lizards, birds, non-avian dinosaurs and mammals, into lacustrine environments for burial. Terrestrial vertebrate carcasses transported by and sealed within the pyroclastic flows were clearly preserved as exceptional fossils through this process.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms4151</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/F52T5N47/Jiang et al. - 2014 - New evidence suggests pyroclastic flows are respon.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-13 19:47:56</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barrett, Paul M.</author><author>Hasegawa, Yoshikazu</author><author>Manabe, Makoto</author><author>Isaji, Shinji</author><author>Matsuoka, Hiroshige</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sauropod dinosaurs from the Lower Cretaceous of eastern Asia: taxonomic and biogeographical implications</title><secondary-title>Palaeontology</secondary-title><short-title>Sauropod dinosaurs from the Lower Cretaceous of eastern Asia</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Palaeontology</full-title></periodical><pages>1197-1217</pages><volume>45</volume><number>6</number><issue>6</issue><keywords><keyword>Early Cretaceous</keyword><keyword>eastern Asia</keyword><keyword>Japan</keyword><keyword>Kuwajima Formation</keyword><keyword>Titanosauriform sauropods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2002</year><pub-dates><date>2002</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1475-4983</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/1475-4983.00282</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Sauropod dinosaurs are poorly represented in the Lower Cretaceous of eastern Asia. Here, we describe a number of isolated sauropod teeth from the Kuwajima Formation (?Berriasian–?Hauterivian) of Shiramine, Japan. The mosaic of shared derived characters and symplesiomorphies displayed by the teeth indicate that they are referable to a basal member of the titanosauriform radiation. A taxonomic review of previously described sauropod specimens from eastern and south–eastern Asia reveals that a diversity of sauropods (including a titanosaurian, a basal titanosauriform and a ?euhelopodid, as well as several forms of indeterminate systematic position) was present in this region in the Early Cretaceous. This diversity conflicts with previous suggestions that eastern Asia was biogeographically isolated from the rest of Laurasia until the late Early Cretaceous and that the sauropod fauna was limited to the endemic East Asian clade Euhelopodidae. The presence of titanosauriform sauropods in the basal Cretaceous of Japan and Thailand indicate that the proposed faunal isolation of eastern Asia ended approximately 20 myr earlier than usually suggested.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/1475-4983.00282</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/VZ5EQWFC/Barrett et al. - 2002 - Sauropod dinosaurs from the Lower Cretaceous of ea.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-13 19:49:54</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, ZhongHe</author><author>Wang, Yuan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vertebrate diversity of the Jehol Biota as compared with other lagerstätten</title><secondary-title>Science China Earth Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science China Earth Sciences</full-title><abbr-1>Sci.

Currently, the Jehol Biota in a narrow sense (i.e., distribution limited to western Liaoning, northern Hebei, and southeastern Inner Mongolia) comprises a vertebrate assemblage of at least 121 genera and 142 species. Among them are 13 genera and 15 species of mammals, 33 genera and 39 species of birds, 30 genera and 35 species of dinosaurs, 17 genera and species of pterosaurs, 5 genera and species of squamates, 5 genera and 7 species of choristoderes, 2 genera and species of turtles, 8 genera and species of amphibians, 7 genera and 13 species of fishes as well as 1 genus and species of agnathan. All these known 121 genera are extinct forms, and only a small percentage of them (e.g., agnathans, some fishes and amphibians) can be referred to extant families. The Jehol vertebrate diversity already exceeds that of the contemporaneous lagerstätten such as Santana Fauna from Brazil and the Las Hoyas Fauna from Spain, and is nearly as great as that of the Jurassic Solnhofen Fauna and the Eocene Messel Fauna from Germany. Therefore, The Jehol Biota undoubtedly represents a world class lagerstätte in terms of both fossil preservation and vertebrate diversity. The success of the Jehol vertebrate diversity had a complex biological, geological, and paleoenvironmental background. Analysis of the habitat and diet of various vertebrate groups also indicates that the habitat and dietary differentiation had played a key role in the success of the taxonomic diversity of vertebrates of various ranks. Furthermore, the interactions among vertebrates, plants, and invertebrates as well as the competitions among various vertebrate groups and some key morphological innovations also contributed to the success of the Jehol vertebrate diversity.</abstract><remote-database-name>Springer Link</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s11430-010-4094-9</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-19 12:35:08</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Butler, Richard J.</author><author>Brusatte, Stephen L.</author><author>Andres, Brian</author><author>Benson, Roger B.

However, recent work has suggested that taxonomic diversity counts taken from the fossil record may be strongly biased by uneven spatiotemporal sampling. Although morphological diversity (disparity) is also frequently used to examine evolutionary radiations, no empirical work has yet addressed how disparity might be affected by uneven fossil record sampling. Here, we use pterosaurs (Mesozoic flying reptiles) as an exemplar group to address this problem. We calculate multiple disparity metrics based upon a comprehensive anatomical dataset including a novel phylogenetic correction for missing data, statistically compare these metrics to four geological sampling proxies, and use multiple regression modeling to assess the importance of uneven sampling and exceptional fossil deposits (Lagerstätten). We find that range-based disparity metrics are strongly affected by uneven fossil record sampling, and should therefore be interpreted cautiously. The robustness of variance-based metrics to sample size and geological sampling suggests that they can be more confidently interpreted as reflecting true biological signals. In addition, our results highlight the problem of high levels of missing data for disparity analyses, indicating a pressing need for more theoretical and empirical work.</abstract><remote-database-name>Silverchair</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1558-5646.2011.01415.x</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/YYPKSU4M/Butler et al. - 2012 - HOW DO GEOLOGICAL SAMPLING BIASES AFFECT STUDIES O.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/5CKIJ24R/6851178.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-19 12:39:59</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Flannery Sutherland, Joseph T.</author><author>Moon, Benjamin C.</author><author>Stubbs, Thomas L.</author><author>Benton, Michael J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Does exceptional preservation distort our view of disparity in the fossil record?</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>20190091</pages><volume>286</volume><number>1897</number><issue>1897</issue><keywords><keyword>lagerstätten</keyword><keyword>centroid slippage</keyword><keyword>disparity</keyword><keyword>generalized Euclidean distance</keyword><keyword>missing data</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019-02-27</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1098/rspb.2019.0091</electronic-resource-num><abstract>How much of evolutionary history is lost because of the unevenness of the fossil record? Lagerstätten, sites which have historically yielded exceptionally preserved fossils, provide remarkable, yet distorting insights into past life. When examining macroevolutionary trends in the fossil record, they can generate an uneven sampling signal for taxonomic diversity; by comparison, their effect on morphological variety (disparity) is poorly understood. We show here that lagerstätten impact the disparity of ichthyosaurs, Mesozoic marine reptiles, by preserving higher diversity and more complete specimens. Elsewhere in the fossil record, undersampled diversity and more fragmentary specimens produce spurious results. We identify a novel effect, that a taxon moves towards the centroid of a Generalized Euclidean dataset as its proportion of missing data increases. We term this effect ‘centroid slippage’, as a disparity-based analogue of phylogenetic stemward slippage. Our results suggest that uneven sampling presents issues for our view of disparity in the fossil record, but that this is also dependent on the methodology used, especially true with widely used Generalized Euclidean distances. Mitigation of missing cladistic data is possible by phylogenetic gap filling, and heterogeneous effects of lagerstätten on disparity may be accounted for by understanding the factors affecting their spatio-temporal distribution.</abstract><remote-database-name>royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2019.0091</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/YA6BU7HF/Flannery Sutherland et al. - 2019 - Does exceptional preservation distort our view of .pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-19 12:40:51</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Blog">56</ref-type><titles><title>Birds of the Mesozoic</title><secondary-title>Lynx Nature Books</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lynx Nature Books</full-title></periodical><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023-08-26</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>Birds are the most diverse tetrapod group today, but they have a rich and complex evolutionary history beyond that of their modern radiation.

Presumably, a geologically instantaneous catastrophe would not cause a reduction in diversity or a series of minor extinctions before the actual mass extinction. Two types of sampling effects, however, could cause taxa to appear to decline before their actual biotic extinction. The first of these is reduced sample size provided in the sedimentary record and the second, examined in greater detail, is artificial range truncation. The fossil record is discontinuous in time and the recorded ranges of species or of higher taxa can only extend to their last known occurrence in the fossil record. If the distribution of last occurrences is random with respect to actual biotic extinction, then apparent extinctions will begin well before a mass extinction and will gradually increase in frequency until the mass extinction event, thus giving the appearance of a gradual extinction. The recorded ranges of fossils, especially of uncommon taxa or taxa in habitats not represented by a continuous record, may be inadequate to test either gradual or catastrophic hypotheses. -from Authors</abstract><remote-database-name>ResearchGate</remote-database-name><urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/4PJZ6BYT/Signor und Lipps - 1982 - Gradual extinction patterns and catastrophes in th.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jere-Lipps-2/publication/213774564_Gradual_extinction_patterns_and_catastrophes_in_the_fossil_record/links/5480b9a70cf20f081e72680b/Gradual-extinction-patterns-and-catastrophes-in-the-fossil-record.pdf</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schopf, James M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Modes of fossil preservation</title><secondary-title>Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology</full-title><abbr-1>Review of Palaeobotany and Palynology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>27-53</pages><volume>20</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><dates><year>1975</year><pub-dates><date>1975-08-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0034-6667</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/0034-6667(75)90005-6</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The processes of geologic preservation are important for understanding the organisms represented by fossils. Some fossil differences are due to basic differences in organization of animals and plants, but the interpretation of fossils has also tended to be influenced by modes of preservation. Four modes of preservation generally can be distinguished: (1) Cellular permineralization (“petrifaction”) preserves anatomical detail, and, occasionally, even cytologic structures. (2) Coalified compression, best illustrated by structures from coal but characteristic of many plant fossils in shale, preserves anatomical details in distorted form and produces surface replicas (impressions) on enclosing matrix. (3) Authigenic preservation replicates surface form or outline (molds and casts) prior to distortion by compression and, depending on cementation and timing, may intergrade with fossils that have been subject to compression. (4) Duripartic (hard part) preservation is characteristic of fossil skeletal remains, predominantly animal. Molds, pseudomorphs, or casts may form as bulk replacements following dissolution of the original fossil material, usually by leaching. Classification of the kinds of preservation in fossils will aid in identifying the processes responsible for modifying the fossil remains of both animals and plants.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0034666775900056</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/ZC8PN8NG/0034666775900056.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-24 11:30:49</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Zhou, Zhonghe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Jehol Biota, an Early Cretaceous terrestrial Lagerstätte: new discoveries and implications</title><secondary-title>National Science Review</secondary-title><short-title>The Jehol Biota, an Early Cretaceous terrestrial Lagerstätte</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>National Science Review</full-title><abbr-1>National Science Review</abbr-1></periodical><pages>543-559</pages><volume>1</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-12-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2095-5138</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1093/nsr/nwu055</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The study of the Early Cretaceous terrestrial Jehol Biota, which provides a rare window for reconstruction of a Lower Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystem, is reviewed with a focus on some of the latest progress. A newly proposed definition of the biota based on paleoecology and taphonomy is accepted. Although the Jehol fossils are mainly preserved in two types of sedimentary rocks, there are various types of preservation with a complex mechanism that remains to be understood. New discoveries of significant taxa from the Jehol Biota, with an updated introduction of its diversity, confirm that the Jehol Biota represents one of the most diversified biotas of the Mesozoic. The evolutionary significance of major biological groups (e.g. dinosaurs, birds, mammals, pterosaurs, insects, and plants) is discussed mainly in the light of recent discoveries, and some of the most remarkable aspects of the biota are highlighted. The global and local geological, paleogeographic, and paleoenvironmental background of the Jehol Biota have contributed to the unique composition, evolution, and preservation of the biota, demonstrating widespread faunal exchanges between Asia and other continents caused by the presence of the Eurasia–North American continental mass and its link to South America, and confirming northeastern China as the origin and diversification center for a variety of Cretaceous biological groups. Although some progress has been made on the reconstruction of the paleotemperature at the time of the Jehol Biota, much more work is needed to confirm a possible link between the remarkable diversity of the biota and the cold intervals during the Early Cretaceous. Finally, future directions for the study of the Jehol Biota are proposed that highlight the great potential of more comprehensive and multidisciplinary studies to further our understanding of the biological and geological implications of the Jehol Lagerstätte.</abstract><remote-database-name>Silverchair</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1093/nsr/nwu055</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/7SNIICDS/Zhou - 2014 - The Jehol Biota, an Early Cretaceous terrestrial L.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/P4VB49S5/1508504.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-24 16:55:45</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bailleul, Alida M.</author><author>O’Connor, Jingmai</author><author>Li, Zhiheng</author><author>Wu, Qian</author><author>Zhao, Tao</author><author>Martinez Monleon, Mario A.</author><author>Wang, Min</author><author>Zheng, Xiaoting</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Confirmation of ovarian follicles in an enantiornithine (Aves) from the Jehol biota using soft tissue analyses</title><secondary-title>Communications Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Communications Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Commun Biol</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1-8</pages><volume>3</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Palaeontology</keyword><keyword>Biogeochemistry</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020-07-28</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2399-3642</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s42003-020-01131-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The remains of ovarian follicles reported in nine specimens of basal birds represents one of the most remarkable examples of soft-tissue preservation in the Early Cretaceous Jehol Biota.

This bird is distinctively different from other known birds of the Early Cretaceous period in retaining a long skeletal tail with unexpected elongated prezygopophyses and chevrons, resembling that of dromaeosaurids4,5,6, providing a further link between birds and non-avian theropods7,8. Despite its basal position in early avian evolution, the advanced features of the pectoral girdle and the carpal trochlea of the carpometacarpus of Jeholornis indicate the capability of powerful flight.

By contrast, the complex changes in morphology that occurred between the earliest form of avian flapping flight and the emergence of the flight capabilities of extant birds remain comparatively little explored. Any such work has been limited by a comparative paucity of fossils illuminating bird evolution near the origin of the clade of extant (i.e. ‘modern’) birds (Aves). Here we recognize three species from the Early Cretaceous of China as comprising a new lineage of basal ornithurine birds. Ornithurae is a clade that includes, approximately, comparatively close relatives of crown clade Aves (extant birds) and that crown clade. The morphology of the best-preserved specimen from this newly recognized Asian diversity, the holotype specimen of Yixianornis grabaui Zhou and Zhang 2001, complete with finely preserved wing and tail feather impressions, is used to illustrate the new insights offered by recognition of this lineage. Hypotheses of avian morphological evolution and specifically proposed patterns of change in different avian locomotor modules after the origin of flight are impacted by recognition of the new lineage. The complete articulated holotype specimen of Yixianornis grabaui, from the Early Cretaceous Jiufotang Formation of Liaoning Province, in north-eastern China, arguably the best-preserved basal ornithurine specimen yet discovered, provides the earliest evidence consistent with the presence of extant avian tail feather fanning.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1469-7580.2006.00534.x</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/PTMP9EYQ/Clarke et al. - 2006 - Insight into the evolution of avian flight from a .pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-24 17:03:48</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qiang, Ji</author><author>Zhexi, Luo</author><author>Shu-an, Ji</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Chinese triconodont mammal and mosaic evolution of the mammalian skeleton</title><secondary-title>Nature</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature</full-title></periodical><pages>326-330</pages><volume>398</volume><number>6725</number><issue>6725</issue><keywords><keyword>Humanities and Social Sciences</keyword><keyword>multidisciplinary</keyword><keyword>Science</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999-03</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1476-4687</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/18665</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Here we describe a new triconodont mammal from the Late Jurassic/Early Cretaceous period of Liaoning, China.

Given the basal position of this taxon in mammalian phylogeny, its derived pectoral girdle indicates that homoplasies (similarities resulting from independent evolution among unrelated lineages) are as common in the postcranial skeleton as they are in the skull and dentition in the evolution of Mesozoic mammals.

The basal forms of this group are represented by incomplete or disarticulated material. Here, we report a nearly complete, articulated skeleton of a new basal therizinosaur from the Early Cretaceous Yixian Formation of Jianchang County, western part of Liaoning Province, which sheds light on our understanding of anatomy of basal therizinosaurs. This new dinosaur shows some typical therizinosaur features, such as neural spines of the anterior caudal vertebrae that possess anterior and posterior alae, a rectangular buttress on the ventrolateral side of the proximal end of metacarpal I, and appressed metatarsal shafts. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that it is a basal therizinosaur (sister taxon to Therizinosauroidea) because it bears many basal therizinosaur characters in the dentition, pelvis and hind limbs. The new therizinosaur described here has unique tooth and jaw characters such as the offsetting of the tooth row by a shelf and dentary teeth with labially concave and lingually convex dentary teeth, similar to ornithopods and ceratopsians.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0063423</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/SP4TGXH7/Pu et al. - 2013 - An Unusual Basal Therizinosaur Dinosaur with an Or.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-24 20:05:49</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lü, Junchang</author><author>Unwin, David M.</author><author>Xu, Li</author><author>Zhang, Xingliao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A new azhdarchoid pterosaur from the Lower Cretaceous of China and its implications for pterosaur phylogeny and evolution</title><secondary-title>Naturwissenschaften</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Naturwissenschaften</full-title><abbr-1>Naturwissenschaften</abbr-1></periodical><pages>891-897</pages><volume>95</volume><number>9</number><issue>9</issue><keywords><keyword>Azhdarchoidea</keyword><keyword>China</keyword><keyword>Lower Cretaceous</keyword><keyword>Phylogeny</keyword><keyword>Pterosaur</keyword><keyword>Shenzhoupterus</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2008</year><pub-dates><date>2008-09-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1432-1904</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00114-008-0397-5</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Toothless pterosaurs played a key role in broadening the taxonomic, morphological and ecological diversity of Cretaceous pterosaurs.

Well preserved and abundant new fossils of birds and dinosaurs have provided unprecedented new evidence on the dinosaurian origin of birds, the arboreal origin of avian flight, and the origin of feathers prior to flapping flight. The Mesozoic avian assemblage mainly comprises two major lineages: the prevalent extinct group Enantiornithes, and the Ornithurae, which gave rise to all modern birds, as well as several more basal taxa. Cretaceous birds radiated into various paleoecological niches that included fish- and seed-eating. Significant size and morphological differences and variation in flight capabilities, ranging from gliding to powerful flight among early birds, highlight the diversification of birds in the Early Cretaceous. There is little evidence, however, to support a Mesozoic origin of modern avian groups. Controversy and debate, nevertheless, surround many of these findings, and more details are needed to give a better appreciation of the significance of these new discoveries.</abstract><remote-database-name>Springer Link</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s00114-004-0570-4</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-24 20:14:50</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Föllmi, K.

These processes likely interacted with greenhouse conditions, and Early Cretaceous climate oscillated between “normal” greenhouse, predominantly arid conditions, and intensified greenhouse, predominantly humid conditions. Arid conditions were important during the latest Jurassic and early Berriasian, the late Barremian, and partly also during the late Aptian. Humid conditions were particularly intense and widespread during shorter episodes of environmental change (EECs): the Valanginian Weissert, the latest Hauterivian Faraoni, the latest Barremian–earliest Aptian Taxy, the early Aptian Selli, the early late Aptian Fallot and the late Aptian–early Albian Paquier episodes. Arid conditions were associated with evaporation, low biogeochemical weathering rates, low nutrient fluxes, and partly stratified oceans, leading to oxygen depletion and enhanced preservation of laminated, organic-rich mud (LOM). Humid conditions enabled elevated biogeochemical weathering rates and nutrient fluxes, important runoff and the buildup of freshwater lids in proximal basins, intensified oceanic and atmospheric circulation, widespread upwelling and phosphogenesis, important primary productivity and enhanced preservation of LOM in expanded oxygen-minimum zones. The transition of arid to humid climates may have been associated with the net transfer of water to the continent owing to the infill of dried-out groundwater reservoirs in internally drained inland basins. This resulted in shorter-term sea-level fall, which was followed by sea-level rise. These sea-level changes and the influx of freshwater into the ocean may have influenced oxygen-isotope signatures. Climate change preceding and during the Early Cretaceous EECs may have been rapid, but in general, the EECs had a “pre”-history, during which the stage was set for environmental change. Negative feedback on the climate through increased marine LOM preservation was unlikely, because of the low overall organic-carbon accumulation rates during these episodes. Life and climate co-evolved during the Early Cretaceous. Arid conditions may have affected continental life, such as across the Tithonian/Berriasian boundary. Humid conditions and the corresponding tendency to develop dys- to anaerobic conditions in deeper ocean waters led to phases of accelerated extinction in oceans, but may have led to more luxuriant vegetation cover on continents, such as during the Valanginian, to the benefit of herbivores. During Early Cretaceous EECs, reef systems and carbonate platforms in general were particularly vulnerable. They were the first to disappear and the last to recover, often only after several million years.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195667111002059</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/TA3F2HXJ/S0195667111002059.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-24 20:17:34</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mississauga~annawhitaker01@gmail.com, Anna F.

However, using these specimens outside their original intent introduces biases and potential misinterpretations. Anthropogenic biases can be introduced at any point during the life of museum specimens, from collection, preparation, and accession, to digitization. These biases can cause significant effects when the user is unaware of the collection context, as specific collection biases are often known anecdotally, but not ubiquitously. In this case study, the University of Kansas collection of Spence Shale Lagerstätte material was examined for anthropogenic biases using a collections inventory, interviews with stakeholders, and a literature review. Biases were found related to collector interest, locality preference, and researcher interest and specialization. These biases create a distorted view on the diversity and ecology of the Spence Shale, and need to be considered in future research.</abstract><remote-database-name>DOI.org (Crossref)</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://palaeo-electronica.org/content/2020/3238-collections-biases</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/FIWXD4G6/Whitaker und Kimmig - 2020 - Anthropologically introduced biases in natural his.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-24 20:22:10</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Raup, David M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Taxonomic Diversity during the Phanerozoic</title><secondary-title>Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science</full-title></periodical><pages>1065-1071</pages><volume>177</volume><number>4054</number><issue>4054</issue><dates><year>1972</year><pub-dates><date>1972-09-22</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1126/science.177.4054.1065</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>science.org (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.science.org/doi/abs/10.1126/science.177.4054.1065</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-24 20:23:56</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book">6</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Hedges, S.

Phylogeny refers to the branching order (relationships) of species or other taxa within a group and is crucial for understanding the inheritance of traits and for erecting classifications. However, a timescale is equally important because it provides a way to compare phylogeny directly with the evolution of other organisms and with planetary history such as geology, climate, extraterrestrial impacts, and other features. The Timetree of Life is the first reference book to synthesize the wealth of information relating to the temporal component of phylogenetic trees. In the past, biologists have relied exclusively upon the fossil record to infer an evolutionary timescale. However, recent revolutionary advances in molecular biology have made it possible to not only estimate the relationships of many groups of organisms, but also to estimate their times of divergence with molecular clocks. The routine estimation and utilization of these so-called 'time-trees' could add exciting new dimensions to biology including enhanced opportunities to integrate large molecular data sets with fossil and biogeographic evidence (and thereby foster greater communication between molecular and traditional systematists). They could help estimate not only ancestral character states but also evolutionary rates in numerous categories of organismal phenotype; establish more reliable associations between causal historical processes and biological outcomes; develop a universally standardized scheme for biological classifications; and generally promote novel avenues of thought in many arenas of comparative evolutionary biology. This authoritative reference work brings together, for the first time, experts on all major groups of organisms to assemble a timetree of life. The result is a comprehensive resource on evolutionary history which will be an indispensable reference for scientists, educators, and students in the life sciences, earth sciences, and molecular biology. For each major group of organism, a representative is illustrated and a timetree of families and higher taxonomic groups is shown. Basic aspects of the evolutionary history of the group, the fossil record, and competing hypotheses of relationships are discussed. Details of the divergence times are presented for each node in the timetree, and primary literature references are included. The book is complemented by an online database (www.timetree.net) which allows researchers to both deposit and retrieve data.</abstract><remote-database-name>Google Books</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><text-urls><url>https://books.google.de/books?id=9rt1c1hl49MC</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Uhen, Mark D.</author><author>Allen, Bethany</author><author>Behboudi, Noushin</author><author>Clapham, Matthew E.</author><author>Dunne, Emma</author><author>Hendy, Austin</author><author>Holroyd, Patricia A.</author><author>Hopkins, Melanie</author><author>Mannion, Philip</author><author>Novack-Gottshall, Phil</author><author>Pimiento, Catalina</author><author>Wagner, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Paleobiology Database User Guide Version 1.0</title><secondary-title>PaleoBios</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PaleoBios</full-title></periodical><volume>40</volume><number>11</number><issue>11</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0031-0298</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.5070/P9401160531</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Paleobiology Database is an online, non-governmental, non-profit public resource for paleontological data.

The rapid diversification of amniotes and other tetrapods over the course of the Late Carboniferous period was recently attributed to the fragmentation of coal-swamp rainforests ca 307 Ma. However, the amniote fossil record during the Carboniferous is relatively sparse, with ca 33% of the diversity represented by single specimens for each species. We describe here a new species of reptilian amniote that was collected from uppermost Carboniferous rocks of Prince Edward Island, Canada. Erpetonyx arsenaultorum gen. et sp. nov. is a new parareptile distinguished by 29 presacral vertebrae and autapomorphies of the carpus. Phylogenetic analyses of parareptiles reveal E. arsenaultorum as the closest relative of bolosaurids. Stratigraphic calibration of our results indicates that parareptiles began their evolutionary radiation before the close of the Carboniferous Period, and that the diversity of end-Carboniferous reptiles is 80% greater than suggested by previous work. Latest Carboniferous reptiles were still half as diverse as synapsid amniotes, a disparity that may be attributable to preservational biases, to collecting biases, to the origin of herbivory in tetrapods or any combination of these factors.</abstract><remote-database-name>royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2014.1912</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/D8KY2LET/Modesto et al. - 2015 - The oldest parareptile and the early diversificati.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-24 20:54:23</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wang, Min</author><author>Lloyd, Graeme T.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Rates of morphological evolution are heterogeneous in Early Cretaceous birds</title><secondary-title>Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>20160214</pages><volume>283</volume><number>1828</number><issue>1828</issue><keywords><keyword>Cretaceous</keyword><keyword>Aves</keyword><keyword>evolutionary rates</keyword><keyword>phylogeny</keyword><keyword>tempo</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016-04-13</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1098/rspb.2016.0214</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Early Cretaceous is a critical interval in the early history of birds. Exceptional fossils indicate that important evolutionary novelties such as a pygostyle and a keeled sternum had already arisen in Early Cretaceous taxa, bridging much of the morphological gap between Archaeopteryx and crown birds. However, detailed features of basal bird evolution remain obscure because of both the small sample of fossil taxa previously considered and a lack of quantitative studies assessing rates of morphological evolution. Here we apply a recently available phylogenetic method and associated sensitivity tests to a large data matrix of morphological characters to quantify rates of morphological evolution in Early Cretaceous birds. Our results reveal that although rates were highly heterogeneous between different Early Cretaceous avian lineages, consistent patterns of significantly high or low rates were harder to pinpoint. Nevertheless, evidence for accelerated evolutionary rates is strongest at the point when Ornithuromorpha (the clade comprises all extant birds and descendants from their most recent common ancestors) split from Enantiornithes (a diverse clade that went extinct at the end-Cretaceous), consistent with the hypothesis that this key split opened up new niches and ultimately led to greater diversity for these two dominant clades of Mesozoic birds.</abstract><remote-database-name>royalsocietypublishing.org (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/full/10.1098/rspb.2016.0214</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/BUDGR6TC/Wang und Lloyd - 2016 - Rates of morphological evolution are heterogeneous.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-24 20:56:00</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bokulich, Alisa</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Using models to correct data: paleodiversity and the fossil record</title><secondary-title>Synthese</secondary-title><short-title>Using models to correct data</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Synthese</full-title><abbr-1>Synthese</abbr-1></periodical><pages>5919-5940</pages><volume>198</volume><number>24</number><issue>24</issue><keywords><keyword>Evolution</keyword><keyword>Biodiversity</keyword><keyword>Climate science</keyword><keyword>Data</keyword><keyword>Data models</keyword><keyword>Fossil</keyword><keyword>Model</keyword><keyword>Paleobiology</keyword><keyword>Paleontology</keyword><keyword>Representation</keyword><keyword>Sepkoski</keyword><keyword>Simulations</keyword><keyword>Suppes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021-10-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1573-0964</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s11229-018-1820-x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Despite an enormous philosophical literature on models in science, surprisingly little has been written about data models and how they are constructed. In this paper, I examine the case of how paleodiversity data models are constructed from the fossil data. In particular, I show how paleontologists are using various model-based techniques to correct the data. Drawing on this research, I argue for the following related theses: first, the ‘purity’ of a data model is not a measure of its epistemic reliability. Instead it is the fidelity of the data that matters. Second, the fidelity of a data model in capturing the signal of interest is a matter of degree. Third, the fidelity of a data model can be improved ‘vicariously’, such as through the use of post hoc model-based correction techniques. And, fourth, data models, like theoretical models, should be assessed as adequate (or inadequate) for particular purposes.</abstract><remote-database-name>Springer Link</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-018-1820-x</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/QVV7DDHH/Bokulich - 2021 - Using models to correct data paleodiversity and t.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-24 20:59:52</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Nanglu, Karma</author><author>Cullen, Thomas M.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Across space and time: A review of sampling, preservational, analytical, and anthropogenic biases in fossil data across macroecological scales</title><secondary-title>Earth-Science Reviews</secondary-title><short-title>Across space and time</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Earth-Science Reviews</full-title><abbr-1>Earth-Science Reviews</abbr-1></periodical><pages>104537</pages><volume>244</volume><keywords><keyword>Cretaceous</keyword><keyword>Cambrian</keyword><keyword>Macroecology</keyword><keyword>Meta-analyses</keyword><keyword>Paleoecology</keyword><keyword>Sampling bias</keyword><keyword>Taphonomy</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023-09-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0012-8252</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.earscirev.2023.104537</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Quantitative studies of fossil data have proven critical to a number of major macroevolutionary and macroecological discoveries, such as the ‘Big 5’ mass extinctions of the Phanerozoic. The development and easy accessibility of major meta-data sources such as the Paleobiology Database and Geobiodiversity Database have also spurred the widespread application of these data to testing ecological hypotheses at finer spatiotemporal and phylogenetic scales. However, preservational, sampling, and taxonomic issues, along with analytical decisions, can impact the degree of interpretative resolution and obscure biological ‘signal’ from error/bias-introduced ‘noise’. The degree to which these factors can impact analytical interpretations is not well-documented in comparison to the scale of their application. Here, we review many forms of systematic bias that can creep into a paleoecological study, from the stage of data collection to the interpretation of analytical results. We provide two case studies where we artificially introduce such biases to previously-published datasets to illustrate their varying impacts on otherwise well-constrained data. The first case study focuses on the Cambrian Burgess Shale (konservat lagerstätte), and the second on bonebeds of the Cretaceous Belly River Group (konzentrat laggerstätte), with both representing highly-sampled, taphonomically-characterized, and spatiotemporally-constrained datasets developed through multiple years of sustained field collecting. In the former, we illustrate the impacts of collecting bias through quantitative comparisons of collected vs. discarded specimens over multiple field seasons and the impact of the loss of these data on ecological reconstructions and analysis. In the latter case study, we review the impact of preservational biases, differing approaches to their mitigation, and the impact of analytical decisions on ecological resolution. Lastly, we synthesize these case studies with our review of past approaches to propose a series of recommendations for future paleoecological and macroecological studies, emphasizing the continued importance of high-quality primary data and ongoing need for a first-principles approach to address existing issues of missing data.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S001282522300226X</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/PWK7ZQZV/S001282522300226X.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-24 21:03:31</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chiappe, Luis M</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Origin and Early Evolution of Birds</title></titles><dates/><remote-database-name>Zotero</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/A27EP2EX/Chiappe - The Origin and Early Evolution of Birds.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book">6</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Feduccia, Alan</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Romancing the Birds and Dinosaurs: Forays in Postmodern Paleontology</title><short-title>Romancing the Birds and Dinosaurs</short-title></titles><pages>336</pages><keywords><keyword>Science / Life Sciences / Evolution</keyword><keyword>Nature / Animals / Dinosaurs &amp; Prehistoric Creatures</keyword><keyword>Science / Life Sciences / Zoology / Ornithology</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020-10-15</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>BrownWalker Press</publisher><isbn>978-1-59942-606-8</isbn><abstract>Birds and dinosaurs have dominated human interest for decades. In this well-supported revolutionary view of the field, critical questions are explored with credible evidence and biological thought. Are birds derived directly from advanced dinosaurs, or are they closely related dinosaur cousins? Did flight originate via the natural &amp;quot;gravity-assisted&amp;quot; trees-down model, or from the improbable “gravity-resisted” ground-up model? Were the earliest birds ground-predators or trunk-climbing gliders? Were dinosaurs hot-blooded with insulating protofeathers, or highly active, cold-blooded reptiles? These are among the questions addressed in this path-breaking book.Current consensus suggests that early birds were earth-bound and flight began on the ground. Reversing that logic, since birds are hot-blooded, by inference so too were dinosaurs, and extraordinarily complex feathers, flight brain and inner ear, evolved before flight in dinosaurs. The iconic early bird Archaeopteryx, despite innumerable flight and arboreal features, is now displayed as an earth-bound predator that could not fly. In reality, we have yet to provide satisfactory explanations for much of the biological origin and early evolution of birds. Among the questions addressed is whether truly feathered dinosaurs are in reality lost or &amp;quot;hidden birds?&amp;quot; The architectural complexity of feathers leads the author to the conclusion that if an animal has evolved extraordinarily complex, aerodynamically-designed feathers, an avian flight hand, flight membranes, and a flight brain, it&amp;#39;s a bird.Birds and dinosaurs captivate and enchant the human imagination. These intriguing animals have dominated the field of paleontology and evolution for the past half century, engendering heated debate on avian ancestry, the origin of flight and feathers, and the biology of their fossils. Are birds living dinosaurs? In this series of entertainingly contentious and captivating essays evolutionary biologist Alan Feduccia writes with verve and humor to expose major problems in the field and advocate liberation from the shackles of consensus thinking about birds and dinosaurs. He maintains that the euphoria of paleontologists claiming to have solved the major problems of bird evolution is premature, largely generated by the adoption of a rigid, cult-like methodology, heavily blended with ideology, and excluding many biological and geological principles. He adroitly exposes and elucidates major mistakes in the field and their aftermath.Romancing the Birds and Dinosaurs is a lucid revelation of clarity and synthesis, a fascinating unveiling of the underlying science that has produced the good, but also often appalling fossil research and wild speculation in bird and dinosaur evolution. A must read for anyone interested in this rapidly evolving field, the short, concise and incisive essays provide the reader with access to this complex topic.REVIEWS and WORDS OF PRAISEIn this strikingly unconventional and brilliant book, Professor Alan Feduccia presents the current status of the recent controversy about the origin of birds with clarity and vigor. A thought-provoking personal exploration of what the bird fossils represent.---Sankar Chatterjee, Paul Whitfield Horn Distinguished Professor of Geosciences and Curator of Paleontology, Texas Tech University.Feduccia&amp;#39;s book eloquently reminds us that consensus science is to be shied away from especially when it is used to plead special cases against basic scientific principles. The concept of “lost birds” is particularly intriguing as it defines what birds are and how special science obfuscates the simplicity of evolution.---David A. Burnham, Associate Researcher, University of Kansas Biodiversity Institute and Natural History Museum.Based on a thorough understanding of the empirical evidence, Feduccia presents a convincing account of avian origins from their putative ancestors.---Walter J. Bock, Professor of Evolutionary Biology, Columbia University and Research Associate, American Museum of Natural History.With candor, clear thinking, humor, and abundant evidence, Alan Feduccia’s Romancing the Birds and Dinosaurs should be mandatory reading for the countless millions who are intrigued by dinosaurs and their relatives, the birds. Feduccia points out the many empirical and logical shortcomings in the stubborn majority view that birds evolved from dinosaurs, an idea now solidly entrenched as dogma in education and popular culture. This new book will be as interesting to those who study human behavior and scientific methods as it will to students of vertebrate evolution.---David W.

Researchers usually fail to account for sampling error in the reported within-study variances; they model the observed study-specific effect sizes with the within-study variances and treat these sample variances as if they were the true variances. However, this sampling error may be influential when sample sizes are small. This article illustrates that the sampling error may lead to substantial bias in meta-analysis results. Methods We conducted extensive simulation studies to assess the bias caused by sampling error. Meta-analyses with continuous and binary outcomes were simulated with various ranges of sample size and extents of heterogeneity. We evaluated the bias and the confidence interval coverage for five commonly-used effect sizes (i.e., the mean difference, standardized mean difference, odds ratio, risk ratio, and risk difference). Results Sampling error did not cause noticeable bias when the effect size was the mean difference, but the standardized mean difference, odds ratio, risk ratio, and risk difference suffered from this bias to different extents. The bias in the estimated overall odds ratio and risk ratio was noticeable even when each individual study had more than 50 samples under some settings. Also, Hedges’ g, which is a bias-corrected estimate of the standardized mean difference within studies, might lead to larger bias than Cohen’s d in meta-analysis results. Conclusions Cautions are needed to perform meta-analyses with small sample sizes. The reported within-study variances may not be simply treated as the true variances, and their sampling error should be fully considered in such meta-analyses.</abstract><remote-database-name>PLoS Journals</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0204056</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/UBZIFQHN/Lin - 2018 - Bias caused by sampling error in meta-analysis wit.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-24 21:18:28</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Wickham, Hadley</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tidy Data</title><secondary-title>Journal of Statistical Software</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Statistical Software</full-title></periodical><pages>1-23</pages><volume>59</volume><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-09-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1548-7660</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.18637/jss.v059.i10</electronic-resource-num><abstract>A huge amount of effort is spent cleaning data to get it ready for analysis, but there has been little research on how to make data cleaning as easy and effective as possible. This paper tackles a small, but important, component of data cleaning: data tidying. Tidy datasets are easy to manipulate, model and visualize, and have a specific structure: each variable is a column, each observation is a row, and each type of observational unit is a table. This framework makes it easy to tidy messy datasets because only a small set of tools are needed to deal with a wide range of un-tidy datasets. This structure also makes it easier to develop tidy tools for data analysis, tools that both input and output tidy datasets. The advantages of a consistent data structure and matching tools are demonstrated with a case study free from mundane data manipulation chores.</abstract><remote-database-name>www.jstatsoft.org</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v059.i10</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-26 10:58:52</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Arregoitia, Luis Darcy Verde</author><author>Cooper, Natalie</author><author>D'Elía, Guillermo</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Good practices for sharing analysis-ready data in mammalogy and biodiversity research</title><secondary-title>Hystrix, the Italian Journal of Mammalogy</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hystrix, the Italian Journal of Mammalogy</full-title><abbr-1>Hystrix It.

Specimens are preserved both articulated and three-dimensional, unlike the majority of Jehol fossils, which are near two-dimensional compression fossils. The site has been referred to as the ‘Chinese Pompeii’ because the dinosaurs and other animals were assumed to have been killed and buried by hot, airborne volcanic debris and ash in a single event; this has yet to be confirmed. Field and laboratory evidence for the sedimentological context of the fossils from the Lujiatun Unit is described in detail, and used to assess whether the fossil remains correspond to a single depositional event and whether this event was the direct result of volcanic activity. Fossils of the Lujiatun Unit occur in several horizons of volcaniclastic sediments that represent multiple depositional events. Petrological analysis shows that the fossil-bearing sediments were remobilised and deposited by water. The Lujiatun dinosaurs and other fossils were therefore not killed by a single airborne volcanic ash, but in multiple flood events with a high load of volcaniclastic debris.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018215001686</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/EHA7VG9F/S0031018215001686.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-26 13:31:51</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spitzer, Michaela</author><author>Wildenhain, Jan</author><author>Rappsilber, Juri</author><author>Tyers, Mike</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>BoxPlotR: a web tool for generation of box plots</title><secondary-title>Nature Methods</secondary-title><short-title>BoxPlotR</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Nature Methods</full-title><abbr-1>Nat Methods</abbr-1></periodical><pages>121-122</pages><volume>11</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Publishing</keyword><keyword>Research data</keyword><keyword>Software</keyword><keyword>Statistical methods</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2014</year><pub-dates><date>2014-02</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1548-7105</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/nmeth.2811</electronic-resource-num><remote-database-name>www.nature.com</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/nmeth.2811</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/EWGZLBAP/Spitzer et al. - 2014 - BoxPlotR a web tool for generation of box plots.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-26 14:50:19</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book">6</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Linzey, Donald W.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Vertebrate Biology: Systematics, Taxonomy, Natural History, and Conservation</title><short-title>Vertebrate Biology</short-title></titles><pages>744</pages><keywords><keyword>Science / Life Sciences / Evolution</keyword><keyword>Science / Life Sciences / Biology</keyword><keyword>Science / Life Sciences / Zoology / General</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020-08-04</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>JHU Press</publisher><isbn>978-1-4214-3734-7</isbn><abstract>The most trusted and best-selling textbook on the diverse forms and fascinating lives of vertebrate animals.Covering crucial topics from morphology and behavior to ecology and zoogeography, Donald Linzey's popular textbook, Vertebrate Biology, has long been recognized as the most comprehensive and readable resource on vertebrates for students and educators.

Computer-based numerical simulations were used to generate clinically realistic measurements involving random errors with a known distribution. For each simulation, two sets of ‘measured values’ were generated to provide the replicated data necessary for the estimation of the random error. Dahlberg's and the MME formula were applied to these paired data sets and the resulting estimates of error compared with the ‘true’ error. Nine different sample sizes (n = 2, 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 50, and 100) and two different types of bias (additive and multiplicative) were examined for their effect on the estimated error. In each case, the estimates of the random error were based on the distribution of 5000 separate simulations.The results indicate that with a sample of less than 25–30 replicated measurements, the resulting estimates of error are potentially unreliable and may under or overestimate the true error, irrespective of the formula used in the calculation. Where, however, a bias exists between the replicate measurements, Dahlberg's formula can be expected to overestimate the true value of the random error even where the biases are small and difficult to detect by standard statistical tests. No such distorting effect was found for the MME formula, which provided estimates of error that were not meaningfully different from the true value even where relatively large biases existed between the replicates.These results suggest the following: 1. A sample of at least 25–30 cases should be replicated to provide an estimate of the random error. 2. Where the original study contains fewer than 20 cases, the estimate of error will be unreliable. In these circumstances, it would be helpful if a confidence interval for the true error was also quoted. 3. Unless one can be absolutely sure that no bias exists between the replicate measurements, Dahlberg's formula should be avoided and the MME formula used instead.</abstract><remote-database-name>Silverchair</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1093/ejo/cjr010</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/6KRAKT3I/Springate - 2012 - The effect of sample size and bias on the reliabil.pdf</url></pdf-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/GXXIV2NQ/633394.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-26 18:58:25</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Qin, Zuohuan</author><author>Xi, Dangpeng</author><author>Wagreich, Michael</author><author>Sames, Benjamin</author><author>Tong, Xiaoning</author><author>Hu, Jianfang</author><author>Yu, Zhiqiang</author><author>Wan, Xiaoqiao</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Living environment of the early Jehol Biota: A case study from the Lower Cretaceous Dabeigou Formation, Luanping Basin (North China)</title><secondary-title>Cretaceous Research</secondary-title><short-title>Living environment of the early Jehol Biota</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Cretaceous Research</full-title><abbr-1>Cretaceous Research</abbr-1></periodical><pages>104833</pages><volume>124</volume><keywords><keyword>Early Cretaceous</keyword><keyword>Jehol Biota</keyword><keyword>Dabeigou Formation</keyword><keyword>Geochemical index</keyword><keyword>Paleoclimate change</keyword><keyword>Paleoenvironmental reconstruction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021-08-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0195-6671</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.cretres.2021.104833</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The Jehol Biota of northern China provides a new and unmatched window for the reconstruction and understanding of Early Cretaceous terrestrial ecosystems. Previous studies on the paleoenvironmental and paleoclimatic background of the Jehol Biota have mainly focused on middle–late evolutionary stages while the less diverse and more narrowly distributed early Jehol Biota remains less understood. The Lower Cretaceous (Valanginian–Hauterivian) Dabeigou Formation in the Luanping Basin (North China), preserves the early stage of the Jehol Biota and can be subdivided into three members. To reconstruct the living environment of the early Jehol Biota, we explored the geochemistry, bulk mineralogy, total organic carbon, sedimentology, and paleoecology of the Dabeigou Formation from the Yushuxia section of the Luanping Basin. Decreased volcanic activity during the deposition of the Dabeigou Formation resulted in changes in its source material from felsic to mafic. The Luanping palaeolake reached its deepest water depth during deposition of the Member 2, and generally exhibited low salinity, while a short time of high salinity occurred during deposition of the Member 3. Analysis on the paleoweathering indices and other evidences, indicate that the Luanping area was generally in cold and humid climate conditions during deposition of the members 1 and 2 (correlated to the Weissert Event), but changed to warm climate conditions during deposition of the Member 3, which coincides with an increasing trend of biotic diversity. Consequently, our results suggest that the increasingly warm paleoclimate and lacustrine productivity, associated with decreasingly volcanic activity in North China, have contributed to the early evolution of the Jehol Biota.</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S019566712100080X</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/R9PYREUC/S019566712100080X.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-26 19:02:36</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kalu, Michael Ebe</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>How does “subjective I” influence a qualitative research question, theoretical approach and methodologies?</title><secondary-title>Global Journal of Pure and Applied Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Global Journal of Pure and Applied Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>97-101</pages><volume>25</volume><number>1</number><issue>1</issue><keywords><keyword>Qualitative Injury</keyword><keyword>Reflexivity</keyword><keyword>Subjective I</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019-04-29</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2992-4464</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4314/gjpas.v25i1.13</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The “subjective Is” are those values and beliefs that a researcher or a practitioner brings to a research project or practice. The “subjective I” enables the researchers or practitioners to ask three sets of questions (a) “ who am I?”; (b) what factors influenced or informed the beliefs and values; and (c) how these beliefs and values affected my approach to developing a research interest, its research questions, theoretical approach, and methodologies. While these questions may not have an explicit influence on quantitative inquiries, it is the bedrock for a qualitative inquiry. Therefore, it is very important that qualitative researchers should engage in the process of identifying their “Subjective I’s” and reflect on how these could influence their preferred research interest, its research questions, theoretical approach and methodologies. This paper has three sections. First, I provided a description of reflexivity, highlighting its purpose in a qualitative research building on evidence from the literature. Subsequently, I provided the strengths of being reflexive as well as identify the potential limitations of not being reflexive in qualitative inquiry. Second, I identified and described three of my “subjective I” as inspired by Pushkin (1998). Third, I discussed how the identified three “subjective I” would influence some components of a hypothetical research topic including its theoretical approach, the research questions, and methodology approach.Keywords: Reflexivity, Qualitative Injury, Subjective I</abstract><remote-database-name>www.ajol.info</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.ajol.info/index.php/gjpas/article/view/186020</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/7QTBFPHS/Kalu - 2019 - How does “subjective I” influence a qualitative re.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-26 19:05:32</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Smith, J.

The model is intended to represent a warm—blooded vertebrate predator and its prey. The main conclusions are: (1) Coexistence of predator and prey is possible, but if so, the number of prey present will not be substantially below the equilibrium number in the absence of predators. Mutual regulation of predator and prey, with the latter substantially below the carrying capacity of the environment, is unstable. (2) Coexistence is more likely if there are differences in hunting ability between different individual predators–for example, between young and old predators. (3) Cover for the prey enables the prey species to survive the extinction of the predator, but does not make coexistence more likely.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1934346</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/888GHFPJ/1934346.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-26 19:13:56</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Abrams, Peter A.</author><author>Matsuda, Hiroyuki</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Positive Indirect Effects Between Prey Species that Share Predators</title><secondary-title>Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>610-616</pages><volume>77</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>apparent competition</keyword><keyword>apparent mutualism</keyword><keyword>coexistence</keyword><keyword>density dependence</keyword><keyword>effect</keyword><keyword>functional response</keyword><keyword>indirect effect</keyword><keyword>numerical response</keyword><keyword>predation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1996</year><pub-dates><date>1996</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1939-9170</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2307/2265634</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Mathematical models are used to explore the interaction between two prey species that share a common predator. The models assume that the predator experiences density dependence via some mechanism other than prey depletion. The models also assume that the predator's functional response to each prey decreases as the density of the other prey species increases. This can occur either because of predator satiation or predator switching. The results suggest that positive indirect effects of one prey on the equilibrium density of others should occur frequently, especially when there is predator switching. Decreasing the mortality rate of one prey or adding a prey species may make it easier for additional prey species to invade the system and coexist. This occurs because the resulting decrease in the predator's functional response is greater than its positive numerical response. In many cases, different magnitudes of perturbation to one prey species will have opposite effects on the population density of the other prey species.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/2265634</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/85TP9RQ5/2265634.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-26 19:17:09</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Olszewski, Thomas D.</author><author>West, Ronald R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Influence of transportation and time‐averaging in fossil assemblages from the Pennsylvanian of Oklahoma</title><secondary-title>Lethaia</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Lethaia</full-title></periodical><pages>315-329</pages><volume>30</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Paleoecology</keyword><keyword>presence/absence data</keyword><keyword>relative‐abundance data</keyword><keyword>taphonomy</keyword><keyword>time‐averaging</keyword><keyword>transportation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997-12</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0024-1164</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/j.1502-3931.1997.tb00475.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The relative effects of shell destruction, transportation, and time‐averaging have been assessed in seventeen soft‐bottom, benthic fossil collections from the Pennsylvanian Wewoka Formation in Hughes County, Oklahoma. Invertebrates were identified to species level, and each was subject to a taphonomic evaluation to determine whether it was in place. Species that were not deemed parautochthonous (living at the location of collection shortly before final burial) were eliminated from the faunal lists to reduce the effects of time‐averaging and transportation in the fossil assemblages. Both reciprocal averaging and non‐metric multidimensional scaling ordinations revealed two biofacies. These were distinguished using both presence/absence data and numerical counts of species despite an overwhelming number of taxa occurring in both biofacies. Comparison between ordinations based on entire faunal lists with those based on parautochthonous faunal lists indicates that the two biofacies faithfully reproduce differences in the living distributions of member taxa but that the two biofacies underwent different degrees of time‐averaging and transportation. Time‐averaging leads to accumulation of taxa over time, thereby making presence/absence composition of collections more similar. Transportation, on the other hand, homogenizes originally patchy population distributions and makes relative abundances more uniform. Based on differences in abundances and presence/absence patterns, the stratigraphically lower biofacies underwent more transportation and more time‐averaging than the upper biofacies.&#xD;Keywords&#xD;&#xD;Paleoecology&#xD;taphonomy&#xD;time‐averaging&#xD;transportation&#xD;relative‐abundance data&#xD;presence/absence data</abstract><remote-database-name>idunn.no (Atypon)</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.idunn.no/doi/abs/10.1111/j.1502-3931.1997.tb00475.x</url></web-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-26 19:20:41</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Miller, Arnold I.</author><author>Cummins, Hays</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A Numerical Model for the Formation of Fossil Assemblages: Estimating the Amount of Post-Mortem Transport along Environmental Gradients</title><secondary-title>PALAIOS</secondary-title><short-title>A Numerical Model for the Formation of Fossil Assemblages</short-title></titles><periodical><full-title>PALAIOS</full-title></periodical><pages>303-316</pages><volume>5</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1990</year><pub-dates><date>1990</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0883-1351</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2307/3514887</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In even the most sophisticated taphonomic studies, processes involved in the formation of fossil assemblages can rarely be directly observed, and are inferred from measurements and censuses of skeletal material. Here, we present a numerical model designed to permit direct evaluation, either alone or in combination, of various postmortem effects on simulated fossil assemblages. The primary objective of the basic model is to provide a realistic framework for species distributions, through several generations of accumulation, on the sea floor. The model establishes two "communities," each containing 25 species and 10,000 individuals per generation, along an "environmental" gradient. Species are assigned randomly to one of five ecologic tiers, and relative abundances are determined using MacArthur's random niche-boundary distribution. With respect to the gradient, geographic centers of abundance and ranges of distribution are also preassigned; they vary from species to species, within limits, to reflect the intergradational nature of the communities. Using these "guidelines," individuals belonging to each species are placed randomly or contagiously on a two-dimensional, 50 by 800 coordinate grid; the model is run through 50 generations to develop a time-averaged accumulation that can be sampled for numerical analyses. The power of the basic model is that it can be manipulated to simulate a variety of taphonomic processes, and the results can be compared directly to patterns that would have resulted without the taphonomic overprints. In this initial use, we analyze the effects of limited amounts of post-mortem transport on faunal distributional patterns. Comparisons of transported and untransported accumulations permit the testing of a procedure for detecting the amount of post-mortem skeletal transport along environmental gradients. To demonstrate its utility, this procedure is applied to a data set of subfossil molluscan remains from St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands.</abstract><remote-database-name>JSTOR</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.jstor.org/stable/3514887</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/3E558TI4/Miller und Cummins - 1990 - A Numerical Model for the Formation of Fossil Asse.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-06-26 19:20:55</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>BOSELLINI, Francesca R.</author><author>VESCOGNI, Alessandro</author><author>KIESSLING, Wolfgang</author><author>ZOBOLI, Alessandro</author><author>DI GIUSEPPE, Dario</author><author>PAPAZZONI, Cesare Andrea</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Revisiting reef models in the Oligocene of northern Italy (Venetian Southern Alps)</title><secondary-title>Bollettino della Società Paleontologica Italiana</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Bollettino della Società Paleontologica Italiana</full-title></periodical><pages>337-348</pages><volume>59</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0375-7633</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.4435/BSPI.2020.12</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The lower Oligocene coral communities and reefs exposed in the Lessini Shelf of northern Italy may record one of the oldest well-developed barrier reef/lagoon systems of the Cenozoic. However, the rimmed-shelf interpretation has been repeatedly challenged in favour of a ramp model with scattered corals. Based upon a re-analysis of selected localities in the Lessini Shelf, we here provide support for the barrier reef model based on four key observations: 1) systematic changes of coral growth-forms from branching in the proximal areas to massive at the platform margin; 2) a progressive increase of the hydrodynamic energy from the proximal belt towards the more distal environments in the Berici Hills; 3) the occurrence of shallow-water, euphotic conditions throughout the whole depositional system; and 4) the presence of restricted circulation in the proximal environments during sea-level lowstands, with lack of coral colonies. These features, together with the evidence of coral frameworks located on the southeastern edge of the Lessini Shelf, substantiate the occurrence of a reef-rimmed margin. The reefal rim acted as an efficient barrier, with the formation of a landward, wide lagoon protected from the action of waves and currents.</abstract><remote-database-name>DOI.org (CSL JSON)</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.4435/BSPI.2020.12</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/XLFRUGGE/BOSELLINI et al. - 2020 - Revisiting reef models in the Oligocene of norther.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-07-01 10:10:44</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>GEISTER, J</author><author>S, UNGARO</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>THE OLIGOCENE CORAL FORMATIONS OF THE COLLI BERICI (VICENZA, NORTHERN ITALY).</title><secondary-title>THE OLIGOCENE CORAL FORMATIONS OF THE COLLI BERICI (VICENZA, NORTHERN ITALY).</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>THE OLIGOCENE CORAL FORMATIONS OF THE COLLI BERICI (VICENZA, NORTHERN ITALY).</full-title></periodical><dates><year>1977</year><pub-dates><date>1977</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/KHXDHK9X/index.html</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Web Page">12</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>crossref</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Chooser</title></titles><dates/><abstract>Choose from multiple DOI resolution options</abstract><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://chooser.crossref.org/</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/49ZJ7QJG/chooser.crossref.org.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-07-01 10:12:42</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Frost, Stanley H.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Toomey, Donald Francis</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Oligocene Reef Coral Biofacies of the Vicentin, Northeast Italy</title><secondary-title>European Fossil Reef Models</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Fossil Reef Models</full-title></periodical><pages>0</pages><volume>30</volume><dates><year>1981</year><pub-dates><date>1981-01-01</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>SEPM Society for Sedimentary Geology</publisher><isbn>978-1-56576-160-5</isbn><abstract>Outcrops of Oligocene reef facies strata in the Vicentin area of northeastern Italy are well known because of the extensive collections of fossil reef corals that have been made from them. This paper presents an overview of the paleoecologic distribution of these reef corals and identifies coral communities indicative of different environments, or of different stages in ecologie successions.One of the largest and best exposed of outcropping Tertiary reefs is the Berici barrier-reef/lagoonal complex of the Castelgomberto Limestone in the Colli Berici and eastern Monte Lessini. The barrier-reef, which now forms much of the southeast face of the Colli Berici, has a core facies which is 150-200 meters thick ×800-900 meters wide and about 8 kilometers long. The lagoonal facies represents most of the Castelgomberto Limestone and extends northwestward back of the barrier-reef for about 30 kilometers. Other buildups of this area include a. patch-reefs and coppices in the shelf-lagoon, b. a basal Oligocene sequence alternating between thickets of branching corals in terrigenous beds and coral head biostromes in carbonates, c. coral carpets and biostromes high in the Castelgomberto Limestone which postdate the Berici Barrier-reef and d. biostromal assemblages adapted to soft mud substrates in marine tuffaceous mudstones which cap the Castelgomberto Limestone.In the Marósticano area, coral thickets, coppices and thin fringing-reefs formed along the northeastern margin of a large Oligocene volcanic complex. These structures developed in a region dominated by terrigenous clastic sedimentation in some cases adjacent to centers of submarine volcanic eruption.Variations of three basic coral assemblages are responsible for the wide spectrum of buildups: a. low diversity t4pioneer?? or thicket assemblage; b. high diversity reef-core and flank assemblage; and c. soft mud substrate assemblage. The environmental factors which appear to have been important in determining the areal mix of species, the community diversity and the abundance of the reef corals, are adaptation to water flow, potential to colonize unstable substrates and to survive sedimentation, and species-specific dominance relationships. Interaction of these factors can explain the seraJ succession of pioneer-to-intermediate-to-climax communities observed in many Tertiary reef buildups.Most of the biomass that existed at any given time when these ancient reefs were living left no trace in the fossil record of these buildups. Particularly important in the ecology of these reefs (by analogy with modern reefs) were the benthic algae, sponges and octocorals. For the most part, each of these groups (except coralline red algae) is unrepresented or greatly underrepresented in the Vicentin reef fossil record. This is because they lacked mineralized skeletal parts or because these skeletons were destroyed before they became part of the sediments during diagenesis. Most of the reef dwelling biota which did leave an extensive fossil record in the buildups actually aggregated a relatively minor part of the reef biovolume, either as standing crop or over a period of time.</abstract><remote-database-name>Silverchair</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.2110/pec.81.30.0483</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/9EVBUBTD/Oligocene-Reef-Coral-Biofacies-of-the-Vicentin.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2024-07-01 10:13:12</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bosellini, Francesca</author><author>Russo, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Oligocene Actinacis coral community of the Southern Alps (Italy): temperature vs. terrigenous control.</title><short-title>The Oligocene Actinacis coral community of the Southern Alps (Italy)</short-title></titles><dates><year>1988</year><pub-dates><date>1988</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>AUS</publisher><isbn>978-981-02-1084-7</isbn><abstract>Examination of the classic Oligocene coral reefs of the Vicentin (Southern Alps, Northern Italy), reveals a low specific diversity community dominated by Actinacis rollei Reuss.

The carbonates are dominated by coralline algal rudstones with a packstone to wackestone matrix. Non-geniculate coralline algae include six genera: Lithoporella melobesioides, Mesophyllum, Neogoniolithon, Spongites, Sporolithon, and Subterraniphyllum. The algae are found in the form of encrusting thalli, rhodoliths, and coralline debris. Non-algal components include larger, small benthic, and planktonic foraminifera associated with bryozoans, zooxanthellate corals, and echinoderms. Four carbonate facies are distinguished: (1) coralline algal facies, (2) coralline algal-coral facies, (3) coralline algal-larger foraminiferal facies, and (4) coralline algal debris facies. Marly horizons also occur in the section. The facies and coralline algal content are interpreted with respect to light intensity, hydrodynamic energy, biotic interactions, and substrate stability.

Characterizing these attributes has been approached by 1) building reference models for specific Phanerozoic intervals, 2) recognizing the climatic impact in modulating carbonate production, and 3) analyzing the influence of changing bio-geochemical conditions. The reference-model approach is mostly based on biological evolution, the climatic-impact approach emphasizes temperature, and the bio-geochemical approach considers the changes in Mg/Ca ratios and Ca++ concentrations in the oceans. To date, however, an analysis integrating all of these factors is still missing. The analysis presented here includes all these factors but also CO2, which is fundamental for both photosynthesis and CaCO3 precipitation. Here we analyze the waxing and waning of Cenozoic reef limestones from the central Tethys region through several steps: 1) on the basis of rock volume, rock textures, associated sediments and light-dependent skeletal components, as records of light penetration and wave energy (depth); 2) on global environmental conditions (δ13C, δ18O, pCO2, temperature); and 3) on the basis of functionality, nutritional requirements and available resources. Through the Cenozoic, water motion, whether induced by surface or internal waves or by currents, increased as the thermal gradients strengthened, both with depth and with latitude. Active water motion is essential for plankton catchers such as corals, but less so for many larger benthic foraminifers (LBF). Pycnoclines in the meso-oligophotic zone would then favor the benthic plankton catchers such as corals, but would be detrimental for many LBF. Warm temperatures favored LBF. The Eocene LBF families predominated during lowering of atmospheric pCO2 by using respiratory CO2 to enhance the symbiont production of photosynthates under oligotrophic conditions and limited turbulence, whereas the Miocene families had to adapt to a progressive increase in turbulence. The eurythermal coralline red algae, however, became preponderant producers in the mesophotic zone during times when the δ13C was relatively high. This explains two apparent paradoxes: 1) corals thrive best when the Earth's high latitudes cool, and 2) the dominance of corals and LBF is inversely correlated, despite they both require tropical conditions and have similar trophic strategies (mixotrophy).</abstract><remote-database-name>ScienceDirect</remote-database-name><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264817217301010</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/HR82L53Q/Pomar et al. - 2017 - Reef building and carbonate production modes in th.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-07-01 10:15:07</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bosellini, Francesca</author><author>Trevisani, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Coral facies and cyclicity in the Castelgomberto Limestone (Early Oligocene, Eastern Lessini Mountains, Northern Italy).</title></titles><dates><year>1992</year><pub-dates><date>1992</date></pub-dates></dates><abstract>The Castelgomberto Limestone is a 200 m thick unit of Early Oligocene age (Rupelian) outcropping in the eastern Lessini Mountains (Southern Alps of Northern Italy). The internal cyclic organization of this Oligocene unit is described and analyzed on the basis of four selected sections; about 13 well-bedded grainstone units alternate with marly horizons rich in corals. This peculiar cyclicity is here interpreted as a response to variations in platform hydrodynamics, i.e. to smaller eustatic fluctuations affecting the Lessini Shelf reef-lagoonal complex. During highstand periods, the shelf was open and relatively deep (20-50m), and tidal currents and periodic storms were able to distribute bioclastic sands. During lowstands the shelf was more protected by the occurrence of marginal reefs and was colonized by patches of poritid corals, mainly branching. Moreover, the largely exposed northern areas supplied fine detritus to the shelf itself.</abstract><remote-database-name>iris.unimore.it</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://iris.unimore.it/handle/11380/449398</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/3DGL37HY/Bosellini und Trevisani - 1992 - Coral facies and cyclicity in the Castelgomberto L.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2024-07-15 12:32:06</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bosellini, Francesca</author><author>Russo, A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>The Scleractinian genus Actinacis.

A combination of several measured corallite morphologic characters and diagnostic features is proposed as a realiable tool for species recognition. Preliminary examination of the stratigraphic and geographic distribution of Actinacis species suggests that: 1) the Tertiary distribution of the genus ranges from the Late Paleocene to the Late Oligocene; 2) the highest species diversity occrred during the Middle Eocene, when the genus consisted of a relatively large number of geographically restricted species; 3) only two widespread species survived the Eocene/Oligocene turnover and reached the Late Oligocene, when the genus became globally extinct.</abstract><remote-database-name>iris.unimore.it</remote-database-name><language>eng</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://iris.unimore.it/handle/11380/449400?mode=complete</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/GRKBGR8L/Bosellini und Russo - 1995 - The Scleractinian genus Actinacis.

of the isotope altitude effect from precipitation allows the identification of recharge altitudes in high-relief areas. However, steep terrains frequently limit the use of this precipitation-based approach. Perennial rivers often provide easy, year-round access for water sampling. However, in high-relief regions rivers may not adequately represent regional precipitation isotope patterns because they integrate isotope signals along their course. This prevents the calculation of an altitudinal isotope gradient from river water samples alone. We present a study that shows how a river-based sampling approach served to determine the altitude effect. Replacing the original sample site altitude with the mean upstream catchment elevation as calculated from a digital elevation model allowed us to establish a plausible altitude isotope effect from stream water. The correction approach was verified independently using precipitation isotope data. This approach can potentially be transferred to other regions where precipitation sampling at various elevations is difficult to determine.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team WoS Importer:2021-07-16</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Myrttinen, Anssi</author><author>Becker, Veith</author><author>Nowak, M.</author><author>Zimmer, M.</author><author>Pilz, P.</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Analyses of pre-injection reservoir data for stable carbon isotope trend predictions in CO 2 monitoring: Preparing for CO 2 injection</title><secondary-title>Environmental Earth Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Earth Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>473-479</pages><volume>67</volume><dates><year>2012</year><pub-dates><date>2012</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12665-012-1710-3</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mader, Michael</author><author>Schwerna, Philipp</author><author>Buchholz, Rainer</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A new approach to quantify system efficiency with dissolved oxygen isotopes during engineered growth of Galdieria sulphuraria</title><secondary-title>Algal Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Algal Research</full-title></periodical><pages>294-301</pages><volume>26</volume><keywords><keyword>Algae growth</keyword><keyword>Closed system</keyword><keyword>Dissolved oxygen</keyword><keyword>Galdieria sulphuraria</keyword><keyword>Respiration</keyword><keyword>Stable isotopes</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.algal.2017.07.026</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The microalgae Galdieria sulphuraria was grown in a first technical approach in a closed system experiment for 29 days. In this time period, 6 separate flasks were sampled for oxygen concentration and their stable isotope ratios (O-18/O-16) in dissolved and headspace phases. The oxygen isotope composition of the water was also analysed as an input for the transfer of its O-18/O-16 ratio to molecular oxygen via production by algae. This photosynthetic transfer of the isotope composition of water was counterbalanced by oxygen consumption that enriched both phases in O-18. For this reason, neither dissolved oxygen nor oxygen in the headspace reached the O-18-depleted oxygen isotope ratio of H2O despite excessive photosynthesis. Oxygen that was produced by photosynthesis accumulated with a yield of 13.96 mmol L-1 in the headspace and with 0.5 mmol L-1 in the fluid phase. This difference was due to rapid degassing of the solution. It was further amplified by preferential consumption of the dissolved O-2 phase. In order to quantify oxygen production and its consumption we determined photosynthesis/respiration (P/R) ratios with a formula that combined O-2 concentrations and its isotope ratios. It revealed a P/R ratio of 7.7 after 11 days. After this it decreased again and moved towards dominance of respiration. With this work our results introduce a new method to monitor the growth and efficiency of algae in controlled experiments.</abstract><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2211926417302011</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schubert, Christina</author><author>Juhlke, Tobias</author><author>Huneau, Frederic</author><author>Garel, Emilie</author><author>Santoni, Sebastien</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An unusual carbon cycle budget of a small stream in a mountain silicate terrain: The case of the Gravona river (Corsica)</title><secondary-title>Ecohydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecohydrology</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>carbon cycle</keyword><keyword>carbon dioxide degassing</keyword><keyword>river water chemistry</keyword><keyword>stable isotopes</keyword><keyword>Western Mediterranean</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/eco.2521</electronic-resource-num><abstract><style face="normal">The current research of carbon cycling in inland waters lacks a sound knowledge of carbon outgassing from small streams.

In this study, coastal sedimentary aquifer systems in northern Sri Lanka were characterized by integrated approaches such as mass balance calculations, Seawater Mixing Index (SMI) and Water Quality Index (WQI). A total of 34 groundwater samples were collected and analyzed for field parameters (pH, electrical conductivity (EC), dissolved oxygen and temperature) their major ions (Ca</style><style face="superscript">2+</style><style face="normal">, Mg</style><style face="superscript">2+</style><style face="normal">, Na</style><style face="superscript">+</style><style face="normal">, K</style><style face="superscript">+</style><style face="normal">, Cl</style><style face="superscript">-</style><style face="normal">, SO4</style><style face="superscript">2−</style><style face="normal">, NO3</style><style face="superscript">−</style><style face="normal">, HCO3</style><style face="superscript">−</style><style face="normal">) and selected trace elements (Sr, Ba, B) as well as stable water isotopes (δ</style><style face="superscript">18</style><style face="normal">OH2O and δ</style><style face="superscript">2</style><style face="normal">HH2O). The EC in investigated groundwater samples ranged from 81 to 5690 μS/cm (mean - 1260 μS/cm) and served as the first indication of seawater intrusion.

The WQI and SMI approach indicated that in the study region, 50–58% of samples are affected by seawater intrusion. Up to 28% of seawater admixture was noted based on the mass balance calculation using Cl</style><style face="superscript">-</style><style face="normal"> (0.55–156 meq/L) as a conservative tracer. This result significantly correlates with the calculated WQI (r = +0.944; p &lt; 0.000). Water isotope values indicated that most of the groundwater in the area is recharged directly from precipitation while some samples showed influences of evaporation and also mixing with seawater. In summary, the investigated coastal sedimentary aquifer system in the northern part of Sri Lanka is already severely affected by seawater intrusion. However, as marked by the dissolution of carbonate minerals under the influence of monsoonal rains leads to the freshening of groundwater. This study showed that WQI combined with mass balance calculations is useful in assessing the vulnerability of coastal aquifers in arid and semi-arid regions.</style></abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus Importer:2022-09-09</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Schulte, Peter</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Freitag, Heiko</author><author>Karim, Ajaz</author><author>Negrel, Philippe</author><author>Petelet-Giraud, Emmanuelle</author><author>Probst, Anne</author><author>Probst, Jean-Luc</author><author>Telmer, Kevin</author><author>Veizer, Jan</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Applications of stable water and carbon isotopes in watershed research: Weathering, carbon cycling, and water balances</title><secondary-title>Earth-Science Reviews</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Earth-Science Reviews</full-title></periodical><pages>20-31</pages><volume>109</volume><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.earscirev.2011.07.003</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dordoni, Marlene</author><author>Zappalà, Paolo</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>A preliminary global hydrochemical comparison of lakes and reservoirs</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Water</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Water</full-title></periodical><volume>5</volume><keywords><keyword>geochemistry</keyword><keyword>lakes</keyword><keyword>major ions</keyword><keyword>principal component analysis-PCA</keyword><keyword>reservoirs</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>2023</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/frwa.2023.1084050</electronic-resource-num><abstract><style face="normal">Lakes and reservoirs are important for environmental anthropogenic functions in terms of agriculture and/or settlements.

We applied a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to group both types of water bodies and to find differences and similarities. The PCA identified fewer variabilities for major ions in reservoirs than in lakes. Moreover, our analyses showed that lakes generally have more total dissolved solids (TDS). Such higher TDS loads in lakes could result from more diverse (and less controlled) inputs from larger catchments and from longer lasting interactions with thicker internal sediment layers. Global median geochemical compositions identified both reservoirs and lakes as calcium-bicarbonate-type waters. This first synthesis provides a basis for future studies and may serve as the start of a global database on these important water bodies.</style></abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus

moisture of oceanic origin can be subject to long-range transport and could contribute to precipitation at distant places. With ongoing climate change the relationship between water vapour sources and sinks is under constant evolution and plays an important role for water budget assessments. This study analysed monthly integrated and event-based precipitation samples from two field sites in the Western Pamir Mountains (Tajikistan) for stable isotope compositions of oxygen (O-18) and hydrogen (H-2) of water. The aim was to investigate water vapour sources and, in particular, to evaluate contributions of water vapour from the Mediterranean region. The latter has been often postulated as a potential moisture source region for Central Asia. Deuterium excess values (d), that serve as a fingerprint of moisture origin, were below 13 parts per thousand in monthly integrated samples, for most of the year. This indicates a smaller contribution of high Mediterranean moisture (approximate to 20 parts per thousand) to the Western Pamir Mountains than originally expected. A maximum d value of 19 parts per thousand was observed in March, which is not in agreement with the common observation of increased Mediterranean contribution during winter (DJF). A Lagrangian backward trajectory model (HYSPLIT) was applied to infer the general air mass origin for sampled precipitation events. A maximum contribution of western' moisture of 40% was also detected in March, while 40%-60% of moisture that contributed to precipitation events in winter was transported by trajectories that originated from the Northern Indian Ocean.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team WoS Importer:2019-05-07</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mayer, B.</author><author>Humez, P.</author><author>Becker, V.</author><author>Dalkhaa, C.</author><author>Rock, L.</author><author>Myrttinen, Anssi</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Assessing the usefulness of the isotopic composition of CO2 for leakage monitoring at CO2 storage sites: A review</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control</full-title></periodical><pages>46-60</pages><volume>37</volume><dates><year>2015</year><pub-dates><date>2015</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ijggc.2015.02.021</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chandrajith, Rohana</author><author>Jayasena, H.

Results were linked with the prokaryotic and eukaryotic microbiological profile of the fish sources using multivariate statistical analysis. Fish from natural environments proved to have better sensory properties in terms of fruity, sweet, and citrusy attributes, compared to farmed fish. However, the farmed fish were found to have higher nutritional value based on their lipid contents. These differences might relate to the introduction of feed extrudates, which could influence the overall quality of fish products. Thereby, malodor episodes linked to musty/earthy off-odor notes related to odorants including geosmin, beta-caryophyllene, (E,Z)-2,4-nonadienal, and (E,E)-2,4-nonadienal. These compounds, in turn, correlated with Asticcacaulis benevestitus, Curvibacter sp., Albidiferax sp., Aquabacterium commune, and Aquabacterium citratiphilum abundance and were further affected by oxygen levels in the water column.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team WoS Importer:2023-02-24</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Michelsen, Nils</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Roßmann, Y</author><author>Bauer, I</author><author>Schulz, S</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>Schüth, Christoph</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Comparison of precipitation collectors used in isotope hydrology</title><secondary-title>Chemical Geology (Isotopic Geoscience) Section</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemical Geology (Isotopic Geoscience) Section</full-title></periodical><pages>171-179</pages><volume>488</volume><keywords><keyword>stable isotopes</keyword><keyword>rain water</keyword><keyword>sampler design</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.chemgeo.2018.04.032</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Many hydrologic studies require data on the oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope composition (δ18O, δ&#xD;&#xD;precipitation and various collector designs have been suggested for gathering corresponding samples.

It considers the health of humans, animals, and the ecosystem as a whole, where health issues cannot be tackled in isolation. The geogenic environment that is represented by the lithosphere, hydrosphere, and atmosphere is an important component and has direct links with noncommunicable chronic health issues among humans and animals. For instance, excess or lack of particular elements, such as fluoride in the geogenic environment, plays an important role in health as exemplified by dental and skeletal fluorosis. Other examples include the consumption of arsenic-contaminated water that can lead to cancer and high background radiation caused by uranium and radon. In this chapter, we provide an overview and highlight the importance of the geochemistry of the living environment and its contribution to the "One Health" concept.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus Importer:2023-07-21</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chandrajith, Rohana</author><author>Diyabalanage, Saranga</author><author>Premathilake, K.

The investigation of kinetic isotope effects has long been established for mechanistic studies of various such reactions. However, so far natural isotope abundance determination of O-2 produced at solid electrode surfaces has not been applied. Here, we demonstrate that such measurements are possible. Moreover, they are experimentally simple and sufficiently accurate to observe significant effects. Our measured kinetic isotope effects depend strongly on the electrode material and on the applied electrode potential. They suggest that in the case of iron oxide as the electrode material, the oxygen evolution reaction occurs via a rate-determining O-O bond formation via nucleophilic water attack on a ferryl unit.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mader, Michael</author><author>Schmidt, Christian</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dissolved oxygen in water and its stable isotope effects: A review</title><secondary-title>Chemical Geology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Chemical Geology</full-title></periodical><pages>10-21</pages><volume>473</volume><keywords><keyword>Dissolved oxygen</keyword><keyword>Stable isotopes</keyword><keyword>Aquatic chemistry</keyword><keyword>Fractionation</keyword><keyword>Water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2017</year><pub-dates><date>2017</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.chemgeo.2017.10.003</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piatka, David</author><author>Venkiteswaran, Jason J.</author><author>Uniyal, Bhumika</author><author>Kaule, Robin</author><author>Gilfedder, Benjamin</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dissolved oxygen isotope modelling refines metabolic state estimates of stream ecosystems with different land use background</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><volume>12</volume><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-022-13219-9</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Dissolved oxygen (DO) is crucial for aerobic life in streams and rivers and mostly depends on photosynthesis (P), ecosystem respiration (R) and atmospheric gas exchange (G). However, climate and land use changes progressively disrupt metabolic balances in natural streams as sensitive reflectors of their catchments. Comprehensive methods for mapping fundamental ecosystem services become increasingly important in a rapidly changing environment. In this work we tested DO and its stable isotope (O-18/O-16) ratios as novel tools for the status of stream ecosystems. For this purpose, six diel sampling campaigns were performed at three low-order and mid-latitude European streams with different land use patterns. Modelling of diel DO and its stable isotopes combined with land use analyses showed lowest P rates at forested sites, with a minimum of 17.9 mg m(-2) h(-1). Due to high R rates between 230 and 341 mg m(-2) h(-1) five out of six study sites showed a general heterotrophic state with P:R:G ratios between 0.1:1.1:1 and 1:1.9:1. Only one site with agricultural and urban influences showed a high P rate of 417 mg m(-2) h(-1) with a P:R:G ratio of 1.9:1.5:1. Between all sites gross G rates varied between 148 and 298 mg m(-2) h(-1). In general, metabolic rates depend on the distance of sampling locations to river sources, light availability, nutrient concentrations and possible exchanges with groundwater. The presented modelling approach introduces a new and powerful tool to study effects of land use on stream health. Such approaches should be integrated into future ecological monitoring.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team WoS Importer:2022-07-15</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>De Castro Bueno, Carolina</author><author>Frascareli, Daniele</author><author>Gontijo, Erik S.J.</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Rosa, André H.</author><author>Friese, Kurt</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Dominance of in situ produced particulate organic carbon in a subtropical reservoir inferred from carbon stable isotopes</title><secondary-title>Scientific Reports</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Scientific Reports</full-title></periodical><volume>10</volume><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1038/s41598-020-69912-0</electronic-resource-num><abstract><style face="normal">Sources of particulate organic carbon (POC) play important roles in aqueous carbon cycling because internal production can provide labile material that can easily be turned into CO2.

Methods: In this study, we collected 13 renal biopsies from patients with symptomatic CKDu (Sym-CKDu) from Sri Lanka with well-documented clinical and socioeconomic factors. We performed light microscopy and electron microscopic evaluation for ultrastructural analysis, which was compared with 100 biopsies from German patients with 20 different kidney diseases. Results: Of the 13 Sri Lankan patients, 12 were men (92.3%), frequently employed in agriculture (50%), and experienced symptoms such as feeling feverish (83.3%), dysuria (83.3%), and arthralgia (66.6%). Light microscopic evaluation using activity and chronicity score revealed that cases represented early stages of CKDu except for 2 biopsies, which showed additional signs of diabetes. Most glomeruli showed only mild changes, such as podocyte foot process effacement on electron microscopy. We found a spectrum of early tubulointerstitial changes including partial loss of brush border in proximal tubules, detachment of tubular cells, enlarged vacuoles, and mitochondrial swelling associated with loss of cristae and dysmorphic lysosomes with electron-dense aggregates. None of these changes occurred exclusively in Sym-CKDu; however, they were significantly more frequent in these cases than in the control cohort. Conclusion: In conclusion, our findings confirm the predominant and early alterations of tubular structure in CKDu that can occur without significant glomerular changes. The ultrastructural changes do not provide concrete evidence of the cause of CKDu but were significantly more frequent in Sym-CKDu than in the controls.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus Importer:2023-03-17</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Piatka, David R.</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>Kiese, Ralf</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Editorial: Greenhouse gas emissions from terrestrial freshwater ecosystems: spatial and temporal hot spots</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Water</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Water</full-title></periodical><volume>6</volume><keywords><keyword>catchment</keyword><keyword>CH</keyword><keyword>CO</keyword><keyword>ecosystem</keyword><keyword>greenhouse gas fluxes</keyword><keyword>inland freshwater</keyword><keyword>N</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/frwa.2024.1390123</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus Importer:2024-04-19</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Kolb, Angela</author><author>Baier, Alfons</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Erratum zu: Stabile Isotope als Tracer zur Bestimmung der Abstandsgeschwindigkeit in Trinkwassergewinnungsbrunnen aus Uferfiltrat (Grundwasser, (2015), 10.1007/s00767-015-0296-6)</title><secondary-title>Grundwasser</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Grundwasser</full-title></periodical><pages>345</pages><volume>21</volume><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00767-016-0342-z</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chandrajith, Rohana</author><author>Bhagya, Sachini</author><author>Diyabalanage, Saranga</author><author>Wimalasiri, Swarna</author><author>Ranatunga, Mahasen A.B.</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Exposure Assessment of Fluoride Intake Through Commercially Available Black Tea (Camellia sinensis L.) from Areas with High Incidences of Chronic Kidney Disease with Undetermined Origin (CKDu) in Sri Lanka</title><secondary-title>Biological trace element research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biological trace element research</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>CKDu</keyword><keyword>Dental fluorosis</keyword><keyword>Dry zone</keyword><keyword>Fluoride in tea leaves</keyword><keyword>Repeated infusion</keyword><keyword>Tea infusion</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12011-021-02694-2</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Fluoride is a beneficial trace element for human health as its deficiency and excess levels can cause detrimental health effects. In Sri Lanka, dry zone regions can have excessive levels of fluoride in drinking water and can cause dental and skeletal fluorosis. In addition to drinking water, traditional habits of tea consumption can cause an additional intake of fluoride in the population. A total number of 39 locally blended black tea samples were collected from a village where chronic kidney disease with undetermined origin (CKDu) is prevalent. In addition, unblended tea samples were obtained from tea-producing factories. The fluoride contents in infusions of 2% weight per volume (w/v) were measured using calibrated ion-selective fluoride electrodes. The mean fluoride content was 2.68±1.03 mg/L in loose tea, 1.87±0.57mg/L in packed tea samples, and 1.14±0.55 mg/L in unblended tea. Repeated brewing of the same tea leaves showed that over 50% of fluoride leached into the solution in the first infusion. An estimate of the daily total average fluoride intake via tea consumption per person is 2.68 mg per day. With groundwater in many dry zone regions in Sri Lanka showing high fluoride levels that exceed 0.5 mg/L, the additional daily intake can rapidly exceed recommended thresholds of 2 mg/day. This can add to adverse health impacts that might also relate to CKDu.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus Importer:2021-04-16</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lee, Kern Y.</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Extreme gradients in CO2 losses downstream of karstic springs</title><secondary-title>Science of the Total Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science of the Total Environment</full-title></periodical><volume>778</volume><keywords><keyword>Stable isotopes</keyword><keyword>Carbon cycle</keyword><keyword>Aquatic geochemistry</keyword><keyword>Carbon dioxide</keyword><keyword>Hydrogeology</keyword><keyword>Rivers</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2021.146099</electronic-resource-num><abstract><style face="normal">Rivers are significant sources of CO2 to the atmosphere, and karstic watersheds are particularly important in this respect due to their large availability of inorganic carbon.

The Mediterranean region is one of the hotspots of future climate change; therefore, data on the water cycle are urgently needed. We measured oxygen isotope compositions in creek water, precipitation, stem water, needle water, and tree-ring cellulose over one growing season to establish the relationship between isotope compositions in different compartments along a fractionation pathway. We analyzed plant material from pine trees (Pinus nigra J.F. Arn subsp. laricio (Poiret) Maire var. Corsicana Hyl. and Pinus pinaster Aiton) at five locations along an elevation gradient from sea level to 1600 m asl. We traced back the oxygen isotope composition from source to sink in tree-ring cellulose in order to identify the water sources used by the trees, and to quantify the extent of isotope fractionation processes. Our results showed that the trees used different water sources over the course of the growing season, ranging from winter snow meltwater to summer precipitation at higher sites and deep soil water reservoirs at coastal sites. Needle water enrichment was higher at higher elevation sites than at coastal locations, highlighting the importance of site-specific climate conditions on the isotopic composition values in tree material. Water availability seems to be most restricted at the highest site, making these trees most vulnerable to climate change.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus Importer:2020-06-09</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Knerr, Isabel</author><author>Trachte, Katja</author><author>Egli, Sebastian</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>Bräuning, Achim</author><author>Garel, Emilie</author><author>Häusser, Martin</author><author>Huneau, Frederic</author><author>Juhlke, Tobias</author><author>Santoni, Sebastien</author><author>Szymczak, Sonja</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Bendix, Joerg</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Fog-low stratus (FLS) regimes on Corsica with wind and PBLH as key drivers</title><secondary-title>Atmospheric Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Atmospheric Research</full-title></periodical><volume>261</volume><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.atmosres.2021.105731</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The French Mediterranean island of Corsica is already today confronted with a clear tendency towards water shortage, leading not only to socio-economical, but also to ecological problems. A potential, but not very widespread source of water is the presence of near-ground clouds, mostly fog. In this study, we investigate foglow stratus (FLS) frequencies in Corsica, derived from a data set of Meteosat Second Generation SEVIRI, whereby a distinction between fog and low stratus is hardly feasible using remote sensing data. The FLS frequency was studied with respect to its interaction with distinct locally-generated wind and its dependence on the planetary boundary layer height (PBLH) obtained by ERA5 reanalysis (the fifth generation of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts, ECMWF). Results show that radiation FLS is formed in coastal areas at sunrise, with low PBLH. On the other hand, in the interior of the island at sunset, a maximum of advection FLS is formed, fostered by locally-generated and related transport of moisture. On the east side of the island, FLS frequency is lower throughout the year due to frequent lee situations. This situation is reinforced by reduced synoptic moisture transport by westerly winds, so that westerly exposed slopes benefit from moisture input by FLS formation.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team WoS Importer:2021-08-13</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Filimonau, Viachaslau</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>From Global to Local and Vice Versa: On the Importance of the ‘Globalization’ Agenda in Continental Groundwater Research and Policy-Making</title><secondary-title>Environmental Management</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Management</full-title></periodical><pages>491-503</pages><volume>58</volume><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00267-016-0722-2</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>al, et</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Gas-phase photocatalytic oxidation of dichlorobutenes</title><secondary-title>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Science &amp; Technology</full-title></periodical><pages>2823-2827</pages><volume>35</volume><dates><year>2001</year><pub-dates><date>2001</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1021/es001939n</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chandrajith, Rohana</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>Subasinghe, N.

In contrast, surface water mixing in the Nagapadduvan and Vellankulam sinkholes was about 41–59% and 33–70%, respectively. In near coastal wells, these values fell to 20% due to the influence of seawater intrusion. During the dry season, groundwater d-excess varied between −5.0 and + 10.8‰, while surface water in sinkholes showed values between +1.8 and −9.4‰.

Although geogenic gas migration along faults and in volcanic zones is generally well studied, short-term dynamics of diffusive geogenic CO2 emissions are mostly unknown. While geogenic CO2 is considered a challenging threat for underground mining operations, mines provide an extraordinary opportunity to observe geogenic degassing and dynamics close to its source. Stable carbon isotope monitoring of CO2 allows partitioning geogenic from anthropogenic contributions. High temporal-resolution enables the recognition of temporal and interdependent dynamics, easily missed by discrete sampling. Here, data is presented from an active underground salt mine in central Germany, collected on-site utilizing a field-deployed laser isotope spectrometer. Throughout the 34-day measurement period, total CO2 concentrations varied between 805 ppmV (5th percentile) and 1370 ppmV (95th percentile). With a 400-ppm atmospheric background concentration, an isotope mixing model allows the separation of geogenic (16–27%) from highly dynamic anthropogenic combustion-related contributions (21–54%). The geogenic fraction is inversely correlated to established CO2 concentrations that were driven by anthropogenic CO2 emissions within the mine. The described approach is applicable to other environments, including different types of underground mines, natural caves, and soils.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus Importer:2020-12-04</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>al, et</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Graedel T, Voet E</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Global Water Balance</title></titles><pages>221-233</pages><dates><year>2010</year><pub-dates><date>2010</date></pub-dates></dates><publisher>Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies</publisher><isbn>978-0-262-01358-1</isbn></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marx, Anne</author><author>Conrad, Markus</author><author>Aizinger, Vadym</author><author>Prechtel, Alexander</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Groundwater data improve modelling of headwater stream CO2 outgassing with a stable DIC isotope approach</title><secondary-title>Biogeosciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biogeosciences</full-title></periodical><pages>3093-3106</pages><volume>15</volume><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/bg-15-3093-2018</electronic-resource-num><abstract><style face="normal">A large portion of terrestrially derived carbon outgasses as carbon dioxide (CO2) from streams and rivers to the atmosphere.

This stream drains a catchment with silicate bedrock. The applied stable isotope model is based on the principle that the 13C ∕ 12C ratio of its sources and the intensity of CO2 outgassing control the isotope ratio of DIC in stream water. It avoids the use of the gas transfer velocity parameter (</style><style face="italic">k</style><style face="normal">), which is highly variable and mostly difficult to constrain. Model results indicate that CO2 outgassing contributed more than 80 % to the annual stream inorganic carbon loss in the Uhlířská catchment. This translated to a CO2 outgassing rate from the stream of 34.9 kg C m−2 yr−1 when normalised to the stream surface area. Large temporal variations with maximum values shortly before spring snowmelt and in summer emphasise the need for investigations at higher temporal resolution. We improved the model uncertainty by incorporating groundwater data to better constrain the isotope compositions of initial DIC. Due to the large global abundance of acidic, humic-rich headwaters, we underline the importance of this integral approach for global applications.&lt;br</style></abstract><urls><web-urls><url>https://www.biogeosciences.net/15/3093/2018/</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Daesslé, L.

This holds true especially in emerging countries where insufficient knowledge about aquifer systems precludes the implementation of advanced management measures, such as managed aquifer recharge. This study deals with the generation of baseline knowledge for the assessment of aquifers in arid and semiarid regions where artificial recharge with reclaimed water gains increasing impetus. The Guadalupe aquifer in Baja California provides water to 57% of the Mexican wine industry. Recent plans foresee a partial replenishment of its depleted groundwater reserves by transferring treated waste water from the Mexico-USA border for irrigation. The aquifer demonstrated to have a rapid response by rising the water table of about +20 m in relation to natural recharge under an intense rainfall period of 236 mm. Two predominant recharge sources were identified based on a geochemical multi-tracer approach: (a) water of modern age (1.8 TU) and mixed water of recent-submodern age (</style><style face="superscript">3</style><style face="normal">H 0.8–1.8 TU), and (b) sub-modern waters that were recharged before 1952 (</style><style face="superscript">3</style><style face="normal">H &lt; 0.5 TU). Water of the first type originate in the main Guadalupe stream, which has a more depleted average δ</style><style face="superscript">18</style><style face="normal">O isotope value (−7.8‰) than average local rainwater (−2.0‰). The stream water initially has a Na-HCO3 composition and recharges the entire Calafia zone and most groundwater along the riverbed across the valley.

These showed that iron oxidation leads to an increase in delta O-18(DO) values. Here we present the first study on effects of elevated Fe(II) concentrations on the delta O-18(DO) in a natural, iron-rich, circum-neutral watercourse. Our results show that iron oxidation was the major factor for rising dissolved oxygen isotope compositions in the first 85m of the system in the cold season (February) and for the first 15m during the warm season (May). Further along the course of the stream, the delta O-18(DO) decreased towards values known for atmospheric equilibration around +24.6 parts per thousand during both seasons. Possible drivers for these changes may be reduced iron oxidation, increased atmospheric exchange and DO production by oxygenic phototrophic algae mats. In the cold season, the delta O-18(DO) values stabilized around atmospheric equilibrium, whereas in the warm season stronger influences by oxygenic photosynthesis caused values down to +21.8 parts per thousand. In the warm season from 145m downstream of the spring, the delta O-18(DO) increased again until it reached atmospheric equilibrium. This trend can be explained by respiratory consumption of DO combined with a relative decrease in photosynthetic activity and increasing atmospheric influences. Our study shows that dissolved Fe(II) can exert strong effects on the delta O-18(DO) of a natural circum-neutral spring system even under constant supply of atmospheric O-2. However, in the presence of active photosynthesis, with supply of O-2 to the system, direct effects of Fe oxidation on the delta O-18(DO) value become masked. Nonetheless, critical Fe(II) concentrations may indirectly control DO budgets by enhancing photosynthesis, particularly if cyanobacteria are involved.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team WoS Importer:2021-08-20</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Lair, G.

Gas samples of fluids ascending in two boreholes (F1, ∼28 m depth and F2, ∼108 m depth) and from a nearby natural mofette were analyzed for their chemical (CO2, N2, O2, Ar, He, CH4, and H2) and isotope compositions (noble gases and CO2).

Studies of the hydrochemistry of karst sources and river solutes are an important tool for securing and managing water resources. A study of the geochemical downriver evolution of the Wiesent River and its tributaries, located in a typical karst terrain, revealed unexpected downstream decreases of nitrate with maximum mean values of 30mg/L at the source to minimum values of 18mg/L near the river mouth. This trend persisted over the length of the river even though increased agricultural activities are evident in the downstream section of the catchment. This pattern is caused by fertilizer inputs via diffusive and fast conduits flow from karst lithology in the upstream area that may have reached the river's source even from beyond the hydrological catchment boundaries. Further downstream, these influences became diluted by tributary inputs that drain subcatchments dominated by claystone and sandstone lithologies that increased potassium and sulphate concentrations. Our findings indicate that bedrock geology remains the dominant control on the major ion chemistry of the Wiesent River and that agricultural influences are strongest near the headwaters despite increased land use further downstream, due to long-term storage and accumulation in karst aquifers. This feature may not be unique to the Wiesent River system, as carbonates cover significant portions of the Earth's surface and subsequent work in other river systems could establish whether such patterns are ubiquitous worldwide.</abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>al, et</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrating EU project Aqua Terra</title><secondary-title>Grundwasser</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Grundwasser</full-title></periodical><pages>131-132</pages><volume>11</volume><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00767-006-0134-y</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>al, et</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Förstner U, Grathwohl P</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Integrierte Untersuchungen in Böden, Grundwässern, Sedimenten und Flüssen: Anwendungen vom EU-Projekt AquaTerra</title></titles><pages>393-407</pages><volume>2. neu überarbeitete Auflage</volume><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Berlin, Heidelberg</pub-location><publisher>Springer</publisher></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Verma, Mahendra P.</author><author>Izquiedo, Georgina</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>Rayes-Delgado, Lisette</author><author>Chandrasekhar, Trupti</author><author>Algabre, Julienne Eve</author><author>Caballero, Marianne Antonette C.</author><author>Godoy, José Marcus</author><author>Sanchez, Mayela</author><author>Brusca, Lorenzo</author><author>Malimo, Sylvia</author><author>Monvoisin, Gael</author><author>Kretzschmar, Thomas</author><author>Villanueva-Estrada, Ruth Esther</author><author>Armienta, Maria Aurora</author><author>De Silva, Nimal</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Interlaboratory test for chemical analysis of geothermal fluids: A new approach to determine deep geothermal reservoir fluid composition with uncertainty propagation</title><secondary-title>Applied Geochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Applied Geochemistry</full-title></periodical><volume>147</volume><keywords><keyword>Geochemical modeling</keyword><keyword>Geothermal system</keyword><keyword>Geothermal water</keyword><keyword>Inter-laboratory test</keyword><keyword>Los Azufres</keyword><keyword>NIST Uncertainty machine</keyword><keyword>Uncertainty propagation</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.apgeochem.2022.105477</electronic-resource-num><abstract><style face="normal">A representative fluid sampling of surface geothermal manifestations and its analytical data quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) are challenging aspects of understanding the geothermal reservoir processes. To achieve these goals, an interlaboratory test for the chemical analyses of ten water samples: one synthetic water, two lake waters (i.e., duplicated), one stream water, and six water samples from two geothermal wells of Los Azufres Geothermal field (LAGF), Michoacan, Mexico, was conducted. The geothermal wells were sampled at four points: (1) total discharge of condensed fluid at the wellhead, (2) separate liquid condensed in the well separator, (3) flushed liquid at the weir box, and (4) separated vapor condensed at the well-separator (data taken from Verma et al., 2022). Sixteen laboratories from ten countries reported their results.

Analytical errors for major ions, Na</style><style face="superscript">+</style><style face="normal">, Cl</style><style face="superscript">−</style><style face="normal"> and CO2-Total are 17, 21, and 42 percent, respectively; however, the analytical uncertainties are relatively lower, except for CO2-Total (19%). Similarly, the analytical uncertainty for CO2-Total measurements of the lake water sample is 18%. Thus, the analytical method of individual laboratories for CO2-Total measurements needs revision. The NIST Uncertainty Machine web app was used for the stepwise geothermal reservoir fluid composition calculation with uncertainty propagation from the samples collected at different points of a geothermal well. The wellhead fluid sample does not represent the geothermal reservoir fluid, including the sample collected by connecting a portable separator at the wellhead. The samples collected at points 2 and 3 represent equally well for non-volatile species; however, the sample collected at point 2 is a better representative of geothermal reservoir fluid in analyzing the pH and alkalinity values. It is associated with considering the effect of non-condensable gases (CO2, H2S, etc.) liberated at the silencer of the weir box. The geothermal reservoir fluid pH uncertainty, an essential parameter for geochemical modeling, is three to four times the measured fluid pH uncertainty due to the propagation process. Thus, the alkalinity measurement and its calculation procedure of geothermal fluid need revision to understand its correction for the boric, silicic, and other alkalinities.</style></abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus Importer:2022-11-04</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Verma, Mahendra P.</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>Monvoisin, Gael</author><author>Rogers, Karyne</author><author>Grassa, Fausto</author><author>Carrizo, Daniel</author><author>Delgado Huertas, Antonio</author><author>Kretzschmar, Thomas</author><author>Esther Villanueva-Estrada, Ruth</author><author>Godoy, Jose Marcus</author><author>Mostapa, Roslanzairi</author><author>Duran Cortes, Hugo Alberto</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Inter-laboratory test for oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope analyses of geothermal fluids: Assessment of reservoir fluid compositions</title><secondary-title>Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry</full-title></periodical><pages>1799-1810</pages><volume>32</volume><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/rcm.8233</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>al, et</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Introduction</title><secondary-title>Environmental Pollution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Pollution</full-title></periodical><pages>693-694</pages><volume>148</volume><dates><year>2007</year><pub-dates><date>2007</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.envpol.2007.01.043</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Liu, Xiaoqing</author><author>Hilfert, Liane</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Friese, Kurt</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Isotope alteration caused by changes in biochemical composition of sedimentary organic matter</title><secondary-title>Biogeochemistry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Biogeochemistry</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Biochemical composition</keyword><keyword>Organic matter</keyword><keyword>Preferential degradation</keyword><keyword>Sediment</keyword><keyword>Stable carbon and nitrogen isotope ratios</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s10533-020-00640-3</electronic-resource-num><abstract><style face="normal">Stable carbon (C) and nitrogen (N) isotope ratios of sedimentary organic matter (OM) can reflect the biogeochemical history of aquatic ecosystems.

In the metamorphic terrain that covers over 90% of the island, EC and TH values showed the strongest spatial variations that likely depend on climatic conditions. A correlation between EC and TH correlated with an r of +0.70. This trend suggests that EC can also serve as a robust indirect indicator of groundwater TH. Excessive evaporation, seawater intrusion and agricultural return flows affect groundwater quality, mostly in coastal regions, where freshwater demand increases. Sustainable groundwater management demands continuous and comprehensive monitoring of spatial and temporal fluctuations of groundwater. We also propose managed aquifer recharge to protect the long-term sustainability of groundwater in both sedimentary and metamorphic domains. This becomes particularly important under projected climate change scenarios in which drier regions in the country are expected to expand.</style></abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus Importer:2024-05-03</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dordoni, Marlene</author><author>Tittel, Jörg</author><author>Rosenlöcher, Yvonne</author><author>Rinke, Karsten</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Metabolic activity of Planktothrix rubescens and its consequences on oxygen dynamics in laboratory experiment: A stable isotope study</title><secondary-title>Journal of Phycology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Phycology</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>cyanobacteria</keyword><keyword>dissolved oxygen</keyword><keyword>dissolved oxygen stable isotopes</keyword><keyword>Planktothrix rubescens</keyword><keyword>standing water bodies</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jpy.13455</electronic-resource-num><abstract><style face="normal">Fluctuations in dissolved oxygen (DO) contents in natural waters can become intense during cyanobacteria blooms.

We investigated various sources of OM including DOC, autochthonous particulate organic carbon (allo-POC), allochthonous particulate organic carbon (allo-POC), and sedimentary matter (SED) in a temperate drinking water reservoir (Rappbode Reservoir, Germany) with respect to carbon isotope ratios and concentration dynamics. For this purpose, we focused on the metalimnion and the hypolimnion, where respiratory turnover is expected to be dominant and hardly disturbed by atmospheric exchange. The observation period of nine months covered a complete stratification period of the water body. Dissolved inorganic carbon (DIC) concentrations and its isotopes (delta C-13(DIC)) were considered together with isotope data of DOC and POC (delta C-13(DOC) and delta C-13(POC)) as input parameters for mass balances. DIC concentrations ranged between 0.30 and 0.53 mmol L-1 , while delta C-13(DIC) values were between -15.1 and -7.2 parts per thousand versus the VPDB (Vienna PeeDee Belemnite) standard. Values of delta(13)C(DOC )and delta C-13(auto-POC) ranged between -28.8 and -27.6 parts per thousand and between -35.2 and -26.8 parts per thousand, respectively. Isotope compositions of sedimentary material and allochthonous POC were inferred from the literature with average values of delta C-13(SED) = -30.7 parts per thousand, and delta C-13(allo-POC) = -31.8 parts per thousand. Comparison of DIC concentration gains and stable isotope mass balances showed that autochthonous POC from primary producers was the main contributor to DIC increases, while contributions from DOC, ExtPOC and SED played a minor role. OM turnover rates, i.e. the conversion of organic carbon towards DIC, calculated with our isotope approach were within the range for oligotrophic water bodies (0.01 to 1.3 mu mol L(-1 )d(-1)). Some higher values in the metalimnion are likely due the availability of settling POC from the photic zone. Samples from a Metalimnetic Oxygen Minimum (MOM) showed a clear dominance of respiration over photosynthesis through bacterial degradation of autochthonous POC. These high turnover rates further highlight a close link with planktonic biological assemblages. Our work shows that respiration in temperate lentic water bodies largely depends on autochthonous POC production as a major carbon source</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team WoS Importer:2022-12-09</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>al, et</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Mixing and transport of water in a karst catchment: A case study from precipitation via seepage to the spring</title><secondary-title>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Hydrology and Earth System Sciences</full-title></periodical><pages>285-292</pages><volume>13</volume><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><urls><web-urls><url>http://www.scopus.com/inward/record.url?eid=2-s2.0-72449186107&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=d9c55e93240cd3c7c296cb5330fe6120</url></web-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>Grathwohl, P.</author><author>Fowler, H.

In this study, DOC concentrations in stormflow were analysed with a physically based modelling approach. A one-dimensional dual-continuum vertical flow and transport model was applied to simulate subsurface processes in a macroporous forest hillslope soil over a period of 4.5 years. Microbially mediated transformations of DOC were assumed to depend primarily on soil moisture and soil temperature. Two conceptually different descriptions of the sorption of DOC to soil were examined with equilibrium and kinetic approaches. In order to quantify the uncertainties associated with the model parameterization, Monte Carlo analyses in conjunction with Latin hypercube sampling was performed. Despite the complexity of microbial transformations, the simulated temporal patterns of DOC concentrations in stormflow showed similar behaviour to those reflected in the observed DOC fluxes. Due to preferential flow, the hillslope DOC export (5.0 ± 0.5 g C · m</style><style face="superscript">−2</style><style face="normal"> · year</style><style face="superscript">−1</style><style face="normal">) was higher than the amounts usually reported in the literature. Overall DOC transport in hillslope scenarios could be described appropriately using the equilibrium sorption assumption. The performed analyses showed that the inclusion of the kinetic description of DOC sorption only slightly improved the predictions of the DOC hillslope export. Moreover, influences of seasonal hydro-climatological conditions on hillslope export of DOC could be observed. Reduced DOC transport during an extreme warm and dry summer was described with lower accuracy, thus indicating the difficulties in the representation of DOC transformations under dry conditions.</style></abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus Importer:2019-09-03</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>Nowak, M.

However, information regarding HS quality and transformations that may affect their behaviour in reservoirs is still limited. The aim of this investigation was to track sources and changes in sedimentary HS across a subtropical reservoir, connecting them to in lake processes and land-use influences. Surface sediments were collected at seven sampling sites in Itupararanga Reservoir (Brazil). Humic (HA) and fulvic (FA) acids (components of HS) were extracted from the sediment samples followed by in-depth characterisation via UV/VIS, fluorescence spectroscopy, elemental (C, N) and isotopic analysis (delta C-13, delta N-15), nuclear magnetic resonance (C-13 NMR) and Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry (FT-ICR-MS). All data were analysed by self organising maps. The results showed that samples from the upstream part of the reservoir were older and more decomposed. They likely originated from C3 land-plants (delta C-13 varied from -26.3 parts per thousand to -22.4 parts per thousand), having more aromatic, oxygen-poor (O/C &lt; 0.5) and unsaturated compounds (H/C 1.1). In contrast, near-dam samples were younger and had larger contributions of autochthonous material. This was confirmed by oxygen-rich (O/C 0.5) and partly more unsaturated compounds for FA as well as oxygen poor and saturated compounds with H/C &gt; 1.1 for HA. Self-organising maps pointed out these differences between upstream and dam areas and indicated that agriculture lands were related to microbiallyderived HS. Changes in HS composition revealed that internal reservoir processes may have influenced HS quality across the reservoir. (C) 2020 Elsevier Ltd.

Our experimental research involved measuring the oxygen isotope fractionation of dissolved O2 in closed-system aquatic respirometry experiments with wild sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus). These fish were either naturally adapted or experimentally acclimated to hypoxic and normoxic conditions. The aim was to observe their oxygen usage and isotope fractionation in response to increasingly severe hypoxia.

Unexpectedly, sticklebacks adapted to hypoxia but acclimated to normoxia exhibited stronger oxygen isotope fractionation compared to those adapted to normoxia and acclimated to hypoxia, contradicting the hypothesis that hypoxia adaptation would lead to reduced isotope discrimination due to more efficient oxygen uptake. These preliminary experimental results highlight the novel potential of using dissolved O2 isotopes as a non-invasive, non-lethal method to quantitatively assess metabolic thresholds in aquatic organisms. This approach could significantly improve our understanding of the critical oxygen responses and adaptation mechanisms in fish and other aquatic organisms across different oxygen environments, marking a significant step forward in aquatic ecological and physiological research.</style></abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus Importer:2024-07-19</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Dordoni, Marlene</author><author>Seewald, Michael</author><author>Rinke, Karsten</author><author>Schmidmeier, Jakob</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Novel evaluations of sources and sinks of dissolved oxygen via stable isotopes in lentic water bodies</title><secondary-title>Science of the Total Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science of the Total Environment</full-title></periodical><volume>838</volume><keywords><keyword>Respiration</keyword><keyword>Atmospheric influence</keyword><keyword>Lentic water bodies</keyword><keyword>Metalimnetic Oxygen Minimum (MOM)</keyword><keyword>Photosynthesis</keyword><keyword>R/P ratios</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2022</year><pub-dates><date>2022</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2022.156541</electronic-resource-num><abstract><style face="normal">Dissolved oxygen (DO) dynamics of a temperate drinking water reservoir in the Harz Mountains (Germany) were investigated over a time period of 18 months.

Areas that are particularly affected with the disease are mostly located in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. The disease is more prominent among communities that consume groundwater as their main source of drinking water. Hydrogeochemical investigations were carried out in the Ginnoruwa area, a known hotspot of CKDu. It revealed possible links between drinking water chemistry and the spreading of the disease. This work compares hydrogeochemical data of drinking water sources of wells whose consumers are affected by CKDu and other nearby wells whose consumers were not affected by the disease.

Differences in major ion geochemistry in groundwaters are possibly governed by variable time periods of water storage in fractured hard rock aquifers in this region.

This process also often causes diagenetic alteration on paleoenvironmental proxies. Yet, mechanisms behind degradation of sedimentary OM and depth-related variations in stable isotope ratios can so far only be explained in part. Degradation of sedimentary OM in two drinking water reservoirs with contrasting eutrophic and mesotrophic states and different catchment land use (agriculture versus forestry) was studied. A 4-step procedure was used to chemically separate sedimentary OM in terms of biochemical composition. Here we presented depth profiles of biochemical composition of sedimentary OM that helped to quantify preferential degradation of aquatic proteins and carbohydrates and the following removal of aquatic lipids. Sediment in the eutrophic reservoir, which reflected a larger contribution of algal-derived OM than the mesotrophic reservoir with a forest dominated catchment, was therefore subject to more intensive degradation of sedimentary OM along with delta C-13 and delta N-15 alterations. In addition, changes in the relative proportions of biochemical components in sedimentary OM had more pronounced impact on delta N-15 values relative to delta C-13. Our findings suggest that the lability of algae-derived OM leads to uncertainties for the estimation of carbon burial in water bodies and obscures paleo-limnological information derived from isotopic proxies. Post-depositional modifications are more pronounced in eutrophic freshwaters that accumulated more readily degradable OM of algal origin in their sediments. Recognition of these modifications will help constrain carbon burial rates of productive lakes and reservoirs and assess the role of reservoirs in carbon cycling.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team WoS Importer:2022-05-27</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Becker, Veith</author><author>Myrttinen, Anssi</author><author>Blum, Philipp</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Predicting δ13CDIC dynamics in CCS: A scheme based on a review of inorganic carbon chemistry under elevated pressures and temperatures</title><secondary-title>International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>International Journal of Greenhouse Gas Control</full-title></periodical><pages>1250-1258</pages><volume>5</volume><dates><year>2011</year><pub-dates><date>2011</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.ijggc.2011.05.001</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Penckwitt, Jan</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Hagspiel, Burkard</author><author>Packebusch, Birgit</author><author>Mahr, Alexander</author><author>Burkhardt, Klaus</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Quantification of groundwater infiltration into urban sewer systems using stable isotopes</title><secondary-title>Grundwasser</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Grundwasser</full-title></periodical><pages>217-225</pages><volume>21</volume><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s00767-015-0310-z</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chandrajith, Rohana</author><author>Chaturangani, Dinusha</author><author>Abeykoon, Sumith</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Edirisinghe, E.

The electrical conductivity (EC) of groundwater was measured in the dry (n = 139) and rainy (n = 78) seasons to assess possible saltwater intrusions, from which 25 wells were selected for detailed geochemical analyses. Water isotope analyses (expressed as delta 2HH2O, delta 18OH2O) were measured in 32 wells for five months. The mean EC of groundwater during both seasons was 2,435 mu S/cm, and higher values from the coastal stretch indicated seawater intrusion. Increasing EC values in the dry period indicated a temporary inland saltwater wedge. High hydraulic gradients with rapidly discharging groundwater partially removed seawater intrusions during the monsoon season. Water isotopes in the region defined an individual evaporation line with delta 2HH2O= 6.69*delta 18OH2O -0.77 (r2 = 0.989), indicating a long enough residence time to allow evaporation before infiltration. Groundwater near sinkhole systems was found to be predominantly of the Ca-Mg-HCO3 type and changes to the Na-Cl type toward the coast. The results of this study revealed conduit systems in the karst subsurface as essential pathways for controlling seawater intrusion.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team WoS Importer:2023-03-10</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Book Section">5</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kühn, Michael</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>Baumann, G.</author><author>Becker, Veith</author><author>Bock, M.</author><author>Buske, S.</author><author>Fritschen, R.</author><author>Giese, R.</author><author>Groß, C.</author><author>Henninges, J.</author><author>Houpt, L.</author><author>Kock, D.</author><author>Krüger, M.</author><author>Morozova, D.</author><author>Myrttinen, Anssi</author><author>Würdemann, H.</author></authors><secondary-authors><author>Kühn M, Münch U</author></secondary-authors></contributors><titles><title>Reservoir and Cap Rock Monitoring</title><secondary-title>CLEAN</secondary-title><tertiary-title>Advanced Technologies in Earth Sciences</tertiary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>CLEAN</full-title></periodical><pages>99-130</pages><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>2013</date></pub-dates></dates><pub-location>Heidelberg, New York, Dordrecht, London</pub-location><publisher>Srpinger</publisher></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>al, et</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Riverine Carbon Cycle</title><secondary-title>Journal of the Czech Geological Society</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of the Czech Geological Society</full-title></periodical><pages>94</pages><volume>42</volume><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997</date></pub-dates></dates></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Juhlke, Tobias</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Huneau, F.</author><author>Garel, E.</author><author>Santoni, S.</author><author>Hemmerle, H.</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Riverine carbon dioxide evasion along a high-relief watercourse derived from seasonal dynamics of the water-atmosphere gas exchange</title><secondary-title>Science of the Total Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science of the Total Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>1311-1322</pages><volume>657</volume><keywords><keyword>Stable isotopes</keyword><keyword>Western Mediterranean</keyword><keyword>Carbon cycle</keyword><keyword>Dissolved inorganic carbon</keyword><keyword>Carbon dioxide degassing</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>2019</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.12.158</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Mader, Michael</author><author>Roberts, André Michael</author><author>Porst, David</author><author>Schmidt, Christian</author><author>Trauth, Nico</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>River recharge versus O2 supply from the unsaturated zone in shallow riparian groundwater: A case study from the Selke River (Germany)</title><secondary-title>Science of the Total Environment</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Science of the Total Environment</full-title></periodical><pages>374–381</pages><keywords><keyword>Dissolved oxygen</keyword><keyword>Stable isotopes</keyword><keyword>Diffusion</keyword><keyword>Riparian zone</keyword><keyword>Vadose zone</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>2018</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.scitotenv.2018.03.230</electronic-resource-num><abstract><style face="normal">Besides gas-water-exchange in surface waters, respiratory consumption of dissolved oxygen (DO) in adjacent riparian groundwater may trigger the addition of so far hardly explored sources from the unsaturated zone.

This finding about additional oxygen sources from the unsaturated zone has numerous ramifications for oxygen related processes in near-river environments including the oxidation of pollutants, nutrients and ecosystem health.</style></abstract></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>Hall, James</author><author>Kalin, M., Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Routine analysis by high precision gas chromatography/mass selective detector/isotope ratio mass spectrometry to 0.1 Parts per mil</title><secondary-title>Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Rapid Communications in Mass Spectrometry</full-title></periodical><pages>1231-1236</pages><volume>13</volume><dates><year>1999</year><pub-dates><date>1999</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/(SICI)1097-0231(19990715)13:13&lt;1231::AID-RCM579&gt;3.0.CO;2-B</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chandrajith, Rohana</author><author>Zwiener, Christian</author><author>Daniel, Christoph</author><author>Amann, Kerstin Ute</author><author>Nanayakkara, Nishantha</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Screening of Micro-organic Compounds in Groundwater from Areas with Chronic Kidney Disease of Unclear Aetiology (CKDu) in the Dry Zone of Sri Lanka</title><secondary-title>Exposure and Health</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Exposure and Health</full-title></periodical><keywords><keyword>Emerging contaminants</keyword><keyword>Personal-care product</keyword><keyword>Pesticides</keyword><keyword>Pharmaceuticals</keyword><keyword>Solid-phase extraction</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2024</year><pub-dates><date>2024</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/s12403-024-00651-7</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Chronic kidney disease of unknown aetiology (CKDu) occurs in tropical countries, including Latin America, Mexico, Sri Lanka, and India. The disease occurs mainly in men who work in the agricultural sector. Although many studies have been conducted in CKDu areas, hardly any have examined emerging organic contaminants (EOCs) in drinking water. Therefore, this study examined EOCs, including pesticide residues, pharmaceuticals, and personal care products, in 29 shallow groundwater samples collected from wells commonly used by CKDu patients. These patients were identified through renal biopsy examinations from the Girandurukotte and Wilgamuwa regions in the dry zone of Sri Lanka. Of 110 EOCs measured, 40 were found in at least one or more samples. Among the detected EOCs, all groundwater samples examined showed the highest concentrations of caffeine (max: 950 ng/L) and DEET (max: 647 ng/L). In particular, the insect repellents commonly used in the region, such as coils, mats, vaporizers, spray and creams, would be the source of DEET in the environment. Pharmaceuticals and personal care products were the most common EOCs in all groundwater samples, with concentrations ranging from 129 (propylparaben) to 1.26 ng/L (carbamazepine) and 1.25 ng/L (hydrochlorothiazide), respectively, followed by herbicides and fungicides. Sources of such compounds would be insect repellents, antifungal and bactericidal preservatives, and agricultural pesticides. Notably, none of the identified EOCs reached critical values and were often below the values in European drinking water standards. Although primary evidence of EOCs as a cause of the disease does not emerge from the results of this study, regular monitoring of EOCs in groundwater, particularly in the dry zone of Sri Lanka, is essential as the presence of these compounds highlights their vulnerability in shallow groundwater wells.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus Importer:2024-07-26</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Melo, Darllene S.</author><author>Gontijo, Erik S.

This demands continuous monitoring; however, analyses of large data sets collected during regular monitoring remain a difficult task. Multivariate techniques offer a fast and robust approach for interpreting complex results. The objective of this study was to check the efficacy of self-organizing maps (SOMs) as a tool to investigate biogeochemical processes. This tool can also help to illustrate influences of land use patterns on the water quality of reservoirs. Here we use the Itupararanga Reservoir in Brazil as a subtropical example. Vertical profiles were sampled from seven sites in the reservoir in a total of seven campaigns over 24 months. Next to physicochemical parameters in the water column (dissolved oxygen, Eh, pH, and temperature), levels of nutrients (NO3-, NH4+, and PO43-), transition and trace metals (Al, Ba, Ca, Cr, Cu, Fe, K, Mg, Mn, Na, Ni, and Zn), and chlorophyll-a (Chla) were measured. These variables were correlated with land use using SOM. With this technique samples were classified into 17 distinct groups that showed distinct influences of spatial heterogeneity and seasonality. The analyses helped to reveal a seasonal stratification period, where Fe, Mn, and P were released from sediments. Nutrients and some metal inputs (Al and Fe) were related to agricultural, urban, and grass/pasture areas around the reservoir. Our approach also helped to explain physical and biogeochemical seasonality in the reservoir.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team WoS Importer:2019-12-17</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Navarro, Alicia</author><author>Endo, Satoshi</author><author>Gocht, Tilman</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>Lacorte, Silvia</author><author>Barcelo, Damia</author><author>Grathwohl, Peter</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Sorption of alkylphenols on Ebro River sediments: Comparing isotherms with field observations in river water and sediments</title><secondary-title>Environmental Pollution</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Environmental Pollution</full-title></periodical><pages>698-703</pages><volume>157</volume><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.envpol.2008.08.007</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Daesslé, L.

Due to the rather complicated pathway of water, starting from precipitation until its uptake by trees and the final incorporation of its components into tree-ring cellulose, a closer inspection of seasonal variations of tree water uptake is important. In this study, branch and needle samples of two pine species (Pinus pinaster and Pinus nigra subsp. laricio) and several water compartments (precipitation, creek, soil) were sampled over a two-year period and analyzed for the temporal variations of their oxygen and hydrogen stable isotope ratios (δ</style><style face="superscript">18</style><style face="normal">O and δ</style><style face="superscript">2</style><style face="normal">H) at five sites over an elevation gradient from sea level to around 1600 m a.s.l. on the Mediterranean island of Corsica (France). A new model was established to disentangle temporal relationships of source water uptake of trees. It uses a calculation method that incorporates the two processes mostly expected to affect source water composition: mixing of waters and evaporation. The model results showed that the temporal offset from precipitation to water uptake is not constant and varies with elevation and season. Overall, seasonal source water origin was shown to be dominated by precipitation from autumn and spring. While autumn precipitation was a more important water source for trees growing at mid- ( 800–1000 m a.s.l) and high-elevation ( 1600 m a.s.l.) sites, trees at coastal sites mostly took up water from late winter and spring. These findings show that predicted decreases in precipitation amounts during the wet season in the Mediterranean can have strong impacts on water availability for pine trees, especially at higher elevations.</style></abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus Importer:2020-10-16</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Daessle, L.

After its transition to water with moderate solubility and slow diffusion rates, most aquatic organisms depend on permanent renewal of dissolved oxygen (DO). Recharge of this pivotal aqueous gas may become hampered by anthropogenic and climatic influences with so far unknown consequences for surface freshwater systems and entire ecosystems. Because rivers integrate biogeochemical information of catchments, their oxygen dynamics may also reflect ecosystem and landscape health. Here we summarize the most important sources and sinks of DO and its role in river systems. These considerations also extend to associated water compartments and fluxes including lakes, reservoirs, soils, groundwater and the hyporheic zone. In addition, for continental-scale considerations, we analysed the GLObal RIver CHemistry (GLORICH) database with 170,369 DO measurements. These analyses revealed that DO in rivers relates to water temperature, pH and nutrient availability. On larger scales, it is also influenced by catchment area, slope, ratios of forests to managed land and population density. Our review also highlights important links between physical and biological influences on DO transfer as well as its sources and sinks in streams and rivers. We conclude that DO monitoring should be combined with novel interdisciplinary tracing techniques such as stable isotope ratios, radon gas and biological analyses. Such combined analyses have the potential to improve our understanding of transfer and transformations of oxygen in rivers as essential integrators of landscapes.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus Importer:2021-09-10</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Finkel, Michael</author><author>Grathwohl, P.</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>Barcelo, Damia</author><author>Charlet, L.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Transfer of pollutants in soils, sediments and water systems: From small to large scale</title><secondary-title>Journal of Hydrology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Hydrology</full-title></periodical><pages>223-224</pages><volume>369</volume><dates><year>2009</year><pub-dates><date>2009</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.jhydrol.2009.03.001</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Juhlke, Tobias</author><author>Sültenfuß, Jürgen</author><author>Trachte, Katja</author><author>Huneau, Frédéric</author><author>Garel, Emilie</author><author>Santoni, Sébastien</author><author>Barth, Johannes</author><author>van Geldern, Robert</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Tritium as a hydrological tracer in Mediterranean precipitation events</title><secondary-title>Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics</full-title></periodical><pages>3555-3568</pages><volume>20</volume><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.5194/acp-20-3555-2020</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Climate models are in need of improved constraints for water vapor transport in the atmosphere, and tritium can serve as a powerful tracer in the hydrological cycle. Although the general principles of tritium distribution and transfer processes within and between the various hydrological compartments are known, variation on short timescales and aspects of altitude dependence are still under debate. To address questions regarding tritium sources, sinks, and transfer processes, the sampling of individual precipitation events in Corte on the island of Corsica in the Mediterranean Sea was performed between April 2017 and April 2018. Tritium concentrations of 46 event samples were compared to their moisture origin and corresponding air mass history. Air mass back-trajectories were generated from the novel high-resolution ERA5 dataset from the ECMWF (European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts). Geographical source regions with similar tritium concentrations were predefined using generally known tritium distribution patterns, such as the "continental effect", and from data records derived at long-term measurement stations of tritium in precipitation across the working area. Our model-derived source region tritium concentrations agreed well with annual mean station values. Moisture that originated from continental Europe and the Atlantic Ocean was most distinct regarding tritium concentrations with values up to 8.8 TU (tritium units) and near 0 TU, respectively. The seasonality of tritium values ranged from 1.6 TU in January to 10.1 TU in May, and they exhibited well-known elevated concentrations in spring and early summer due to increased stratosphere-troposphere exchange. However, this pattern was interrupted by extreme events. The average altitude of trajectories was correlated with the tritium concentrations in precipitation, especially in spring and early summer and if outlier values of extreme tritium concentrations were excluded. However, in combination with the trajectory information, these outlier values proved to be valuable for improving the comprehension of tritium movement in the atmosphere. Our work shows how event-based tritium research can advance the understanding of its distribution in the atmosphere.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team Scopus Importer:2020-04-07</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Orozco-Duran, A.</author><author>Daessle, L.

messageBlack pine and Maritime pine exhibit considerable differences in growth phenology across elevation belts with a 1-month delay for xylogenesis and increasing growth rates from low, mid to high elevations.Investigating seasonal wood formation is crucial to understand tree growth responses to climate impact. The present study quantifies the variability of xylogenesis along an elevation gradient on the Mediterranean island of Corsica, where two native pine species (Pinus nigra Arnold ssp. laricio Maire and Pinus pinaster Aiton) grow from the upper tree line to sea level, partly in sympatry. We extracted microcores from 35 trees at 5 sites along an East-West transect from the coasts (10 m asl) to the island's central mountain ridge (1600 m asl) during bi-weekly sampling campaigns between 2017 and 2019. We applied generalised additive models to detect radial growth differences in elevation and species along with minimum temperatures for growth initiation. We found that trees in low elevations experienced over 2 months longer growth periods with higher maximum growth rates than in high elevations. The results show a 1-month delay for the beginning of tracheid formation between the low, mid and high-elevation belts but comparable timing for its termination. At the sites where both species co-occur, P. nigra accumulates more radial cells in a shorter time than P. pinaster. Trees at the two contrasting coastal sites have similar growth period lengths, but exhibit a time shift of over a month. Minimum temperatures around growth initiation vary between 3.1 degrees C for P. nigra and 9.9 degrees C for P. pinaster. These findings emphasise the high plasticity in the growth behaviour of one of the most widespread tree genera in Mediterranean and temperate zones.</abstract><research-notes>CRIS-Team WoS Importer:2023-04-07</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Amado-Filho, G.

Rhodolith beds stand with kelp beds, seagrass meadows, and coralline algal reefs as one of the world's four largest macrophyte-dominated benthic communities. Geographic distribution of rhodolith beds is discontinuous, with large concentrations off Japan, Australia and the Gulf of California, as well as in the Mediterranean, North Atlantic, eastern Caribbean and Brazil. Although there are major gaps in terms of seabed habitat mapping, the largest rhodolith beds are purported to occur off Brazil, where these communities are recorded across a wide latitudinal range (2°N - 27°S). To quantify their extent, we carried out an inter-reefal seabed habitat survey on the Abrolhos Shelf (16°50′ - 19°45′S) off eastern Brazil, and confirmed the most expansive and contiguous rhodolith bed in the world, covering about 20,900 km2. Distribution, extent, composition and structure of this bed were assessed with side scan sonar, remotely operated vehicles, and SCUBA. The mean rate of CaCO3 production was estimated from in situ growth assays at 1.07 kg m−2 yr−1, with a total production rate of 0.025 Gt yr−1, comparable to those of the world's largest biogenic CaCO3 deposits. These gigantic rhodolith beds, of areal extent equivalent to the Great Barrier Reef, Australia, are a critical, yet poorly understood component of the tropical South Atlantic Ocean. Based on the relatively high vulnerability of coralline algae to ocean acidification, these beds are likely to experience a profound restructuring in the coming decades.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;publisher: Public Library of Science</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0035171</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Anagnostou, E.</author><author>Williams, B.</author><author>Westfield, I.</author><author>Foster, G.

Precisely reconstructing acidification and temperature variations throughout the Holocene will provide a vital context for interpreting current environmental changes and future climate projections in the region. However, existing paleoenvironmental reconstructions are sparse and uncertain, largely owing to limited availability of high fidelity paleoceanographic archives, such as marine carbonates, in high latitude waters. Coralline algae of the genus Clathromorphum have emerged as key candidates for reconstructing high-latitude environmental variability at annual to sub-annual resolution. Here, we present the first empirical calibrations of boron isotope-pH and Mg/Li-temperature relationships within the long-lived, crustose coralline red alga Clathromorphum compactum. Calibration experiments were performed in triplicate, growing wild-collected specimens for four months at three controlled temperatures (6.4–12.4 °C) and four pCO2 conditions (352–3230 ppm), to test the effects of these environmental parameters on the isotopic and elemental composition of the algal skeleton. We find that boron isotopes within the skeleton of C. compactum (δ11Bcc) are well correlated with δ11B of seawater borate (δ11Βborate), defining the following equation: δ11Βcc (2σ) = 1.46 (0.06) δ11Βborate + 6.91 (0.72). This equation can be used to reconstruct δ11Βborate of the coralline alga's ambient seawater, from which past seawater pH can be calculated. We also identified a strong correlation between skeletal Mg/Li ratio and seawater temperature, defined by the equation: Mg/Li (2σ) = 0.17 (0.02) temperature (oC) + 1.02 (0.16). Therefore, despite the strong biological control that this species appears to exert on calcification site pH (elevated 1.0–1.6 pH units above seawater pH, inferred from δ11Bcc &amp;gt; δ11Βborate), and the apparent relationship between skeletal extension rate and skeletal Li/Ca and Mg/Ca, the δ11Bcc and Mg/Li ratios of the coralline alga's skeleton strongly and significantly respond to ambient seawater pH and temperature, respectively.

A Bank facies is built up by the unattached coralline algae Lithothamnium corallioides and Phymatolithon calcareum. This autochthonous facies occurs in shallow sheltered environments. In exposed areas a rippled Clean Algal Gravel facies is found composed of coralline and molluscan debris. In intermediate energy areas a Muddy Algal Gravel facies is found with small amounts of live corallines. Sheltered creeks have a Mud facies which is partly carbonate and partly terrigenous. The shallow water coralline algal sediments are overlapped by a Fine Sand facies of mixed biogenic composition. Each facies is characterized by particular phenotypic growth forms of the unattached corallines. Rates of organic calcium carbonate production are obtained which are found to be similar to rates from shallow tropical non-reef environments. The carbonate sediments of Mannin Bay are compared with similar sediments from Kilkerrin Bay. Ireland, from Brittany and from Falmouth Harbour. From these comparisons, facies models are proposed for these carbonate sediments. The major factor controlling facies distribution is coastal morphology. The present day shelf is considered to be too exposed to preserve complete sequences of the shallow water sediments.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;publisher: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1002/gj.3350150203</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Bosence, D.

However, photophysiology has multiple components that OA may affect differently, especially under different light environments, with potentially contrasting consequences for photosynthetic performance. Furthermore, because photosynthesis affects energetic budgets and internal acid-base dynamics, changes in it due to OA or light could mediate the sensitivity of other biological processes to OA (e.g. respiration and calcification). To better understand these effects, we conducted experiments on Porolithon onkodes, a common crustose coralline alga in Pacific coral reefs, crossing pCO2 and light treatments. Results indicate OA inhibited some aspects of photophysiology (maximum photochemical efficiency), facilitated others (alpha, the responsiveness of photosynthesis to sub-saturating light), and had no effect on others (maximum gross photosynthesis), with the first two effects depending on treatment light level. Light also exacerbated the increase in dark-adapted respiration under OA, but did not alter the decline in calcification. Light-adapted respiration did not respond to OA, potentially due to indirect effects of photosynthesis. Combined, results indicate OA will interact with light to alter energetic budgets and potentially resource allocation among photosynthetic processes in P. onkodes, likely shifting its light tolerance, and constraining it to a narrower range of light environments.</abstract><research-notes>Briggs, Amy A&#xD;Carpenter, Robert C&#xD;eng&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;England&#xD;Sci Rep. 2019 Mar 8;9(1):3986. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-40620-8.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: Department of Biology, California State University, Northridge, Northridge, CA, USA. amy.briggs@uga.edu.

It is presently unknown what effects this will have on Arctic calcifying organisms and the ecosystems of which they are integral components. So far, acidification effects on crustose coralline red algae (CCA) have only been studied in tropical and Mediterranean species. In this work, we investigated calcification rates of the CCA Lithothamnion glaciale collected in northwest Svalbard in laboratory experiments under future atmospheric CO 2 concentrations. The algae were exposed to simulated Arctic summer and winter light conditions in 2 separate experiments at optimum growth temperatures. We found a significant negative effect of increased CO 2 levels on the net calcification rates of L. glaciale in both experiments. Annual mean net dissolution of L. glaciale was estimated to start at an aragonite saturation state between 1.1 and 0.9 which is projected to occur in parts of the Arctic surface ocean between 2030 and 2050 if emissions follow 'business as usual' scenarios (SRES A2; IPCC 2007). The massive skeleton of CCA, which consist of more than 80% calcium carbonate, is considered crucial to withstanding natural stresses such as water movement, overgrowth or grazing. The observed strong negative response of this Arctic CCA to increased CO 2 levels suggests severe threats of the projected ocean acidification for an important habitat provider in the Arctic coastal ocean. © Inter-Research 2011.</abstract><research-notes>Cited By :50&#xD;Export Date: 15 May 2020&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;section: 79&#xD;work-type: Article</research-notes><remote-database-name>Scopus</remote-database-name><urls><text-urls><url>https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps_oa/m441p079.pdf</url><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-81255164761&amp;doi=10.3354%2fmeps09405&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=8657bc6821db2fbbfcbd376dfcc8ee46</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Canals, M.</author><author>Ballesteros, E.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Production of carbonate particles by phytobenthic communities on the Mallorca-Menorca shelf, northwestern Mediterranean Sea</title><secondary-title>Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Deep Sea Research Part II: Topical Studies in Oceanography</full-title></periodical><pages>611-629</pages><volume>44</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><dates><year>1997</year><pub-dates><date>1997/01/01/</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0967-0645</isbn><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1016/S0967-0645(96)00095-1</electronic-resource-num><abstract>In this paper the carbonate content and production, both at the species level and at the community level, is quantified in four areas of the Mallorca-Menorca shelf, northwestern Mediterranean Sea. Eight benthic communities are identified, each living at specific depth ranges and preferentially colonising either rocky or sedimented soft bottoms: (1) Photophilic algae, (2) Hemisciaphilic algae, (3) Coralligenous algal-dominated, (4) Coralligenous animal-dominated, (5) Caulerpa-Cymodocea meadows, (6) Posidonia oceanica meadows, (7) maërl and free-Peyssonelia beds, and (8) sandy bottom communities. Encrusting and maërl species of Corallinales and of the red algal genus Peyssonnelia and, to a lesser extent, the green alga Halimeda tuna, are the main carbonate producers. Most of the modern algal carbonate production in the Mallorca-Menorca shelf occurs at depths of less than 85–90 m, which is the lower limit of the coralligenous and maërl communities. Algal carbonate production in rocky areas is usually higher than that of soft bottoms, with the exception of the maërl beds in moderately deep waters (40–85 m). The highest algal carbonate production is found in coralligenous algal-dominated rocky bottoms (464.6 g m−2 year−1), photophilic algal communities (289.4 g m−2 year−1) and maërl beds (210 g m−2 year−1), while the lowest is displayed by seagrass meadows (60 to 70 g m−2 year−1) and sandy bottoms (0.5 g m−2 year−1). Nevertheless, the contribution of seagrass beds to benthic carbonate production in the Mallorca-Menorca shelf is outstanding due to the extent of the area occupied by these beds. The mean algal carbonate production rate over the upper 100 m water depth in the studied localities ranges from 90.60 to 123.89 g m−2 year−1, which correspond to the mostly sedimented Campos area and to the very rocky South Cabrera area, respectively. Overall mean carbonate production of the Mallorca-Menorca shelf is around 100 g CO3Ca m−2 year−1. These results may be viewed as a minimum estimate for total carbonate production on the Mallorca-Menorca shelf since they take into account only the phytobenthos.</abstract><urls><text-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0967064596000951</url><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0967064596000951?via%3Dihub</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Caragnano, Annalisa</author><author>Basso, Daniela</author><author>Rodondi, Graziella</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Growth rates and ecology of coralline rhodoliths from the Ras Ghamila back reef lagoon, Red Sea</title><secondary-title>Marine Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Marine Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>713-726</pages><volume>37</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><keywords><keyword>Accretion rate</keyword><keyword>calcareous red algae</keyword><keyword>free-living Corallinales</keyword><keyword>Gulf of Aqaba</keyword><keyword>marginal growth</keyword><keyword>Sinai</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2016</year><pub-dates><date>2016/08/01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0173-9565</isbn><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1111/maec.12371</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Abstract Rhodoliths are important marine carbonate producers that provide habitat for several marine organisms, and are threatened by ongoing global climate change. Meter-sized sedimentary patches rich in living rhodoliths, interspersed among corals, were discovered in the back reef of Ras Ghamila lagoon, Southern Sinai, at less than 1 m water depth. In this shallow and relatively sheltered subtropical environment, rhodoliths were found to be monospecific or oligospecific, spheroidal, 3.5 to 9.4 cm in maximum diameter, with warty/lumpy or fruticose (protuberance degree IV) growth forms, and corresponded to the unattached branches or praline type. They grew in bright light under seasonal, moderate, wind-driven water motion. The dominant rhodolith-forming species recorded were: Lithophyllum kotschyanum, Porolithon onkodes, Hydrolithon sp. and three species of Neogoniolithon: Neogoniolithon fosliei, Neogoniolithon brassica-florida, and an undescribed species noted in the text as Neogoniolithon sp. A total of 38 Alizarin-stained rhodoliths was released in the field and collected after 1 year. They showed different banding patterns (alternating long and short cells) that revealed seasonal growth, with the lowest rates occurring in winter for all species, and an additional summer growth slackening in Neogoniolithon fosliei. Lithophyllum kotschyanum presented evidence of occasional growth cessation, possibly due to temporary burial. The observed annual growth rate of rhodoliths was unrelated to their size. The mean accretion rates were 1.08 mm · year?1 in L. kotschyanum, 0.75 mm · year?1 in P. onkodes, 0.49 mm · year?1 in Hydrolithon sp., 0.85 mm mm · year?1 in N. fosliei, 0.63 mm · year?1 in N. brassica-florida and 0.57 mm · year?1 in Neogoniolithon sp. The annual mean marginal elongation rate for these taxa was respectively 8.74, 13.92, 3.59, 9.40 and 9.25 mm · year?1, with the exception of Neogoniolithon sp., for which this parameter was not recorded. Maximum marginal elongation occurred in P. onkodes pointing out its greater ability as a space competitor in comparison with the other rhodolith species. The highest accretion rate and common presence of L. kotschyanum indicate its importance as carbonate producer in tropical reef.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;publisher: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1111/maec.12371</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Thesis">32</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Chisholm, John R.

Calcification (C) was regressed against irradiance (I) and modeled using a general exponential function. C-I models yielded estimates of gross calcification that ranged from 9.6 mmol CaCO3 m−2 h−1 at 0 m to 2.0 mmol CaCO3 m−2 h−1 at 18 m. A significant proportion of all samples exhibited CaCO3 dissolution in the dark. Integration of C-I models with half sine-curve approximations of whole-day irradiance yielded estimated net deposition rates of 0.82 to 9.1 g CaCO3 m−2 d−1. Net 24-h calcification was linearly correlated with noontime irradiance. Daily CaCO3 deposition as a function of reef surface relief (3.1 for the crest and 5.0 for the slope) indicated potential contributions to reef accretion of 4.1 to 28.1 g m−2 d−1, assuming 100% coralline cover. These estimates predict annual deposition rates of 1.5 to 10.3 kg CaCO3 m−2 yr−1, provided that measurements made between late summer and mid-winter are representative of calcification throughout the year. Since observed accretion falls far short of the quantities predicted by these measurements, erosive agencies must remove much of the CaCO3 deposited annually by crustose coralline algae on windward reef margins.</abstract><urls><text-urls><url>https://aslopubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.4319/lo.2000.45.7.1476</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Comeau, S.</author><author>Cornwall, C.

However, long-term assessments of the impacts of OA are scarce, limiting the understanding of the capacity of corals and coralline algae to acclimatize to high partial pressure of carbon dioxide (p(CO)(2)) levels. Species-specific sensitivities to OA are influenced by its impacts on chemistry within the calcifying fluid (CF). Here, we investigate the capacity of multiple coral and calcifying macroalgal species to acclimatize to elevated p(CO)(2) by determining their chemistry in the CF during a year-long experiment. We found no evidence of acclimatization to elevated p(CO)(2) across any of the tested taxa. The effects of increasing seawater p(CO)(2) on the CF chemistry were rapid and persisted until the end of the experiment. Our results show that acclimatization of the CF chemistry does not occur within one year, which confirms the threat of OA for future reef accretion and ecological function.</abstract><research-notes>Comeau, S.

Here, two corals with different morphologies and one coralline alga were maintained under two different regimes of flow velocities, pH, and light intensities in a 12 flumes experimental system for a period of 27 weeks. We used a combination of geochemical proxies, physiological and micro-probe measurements to assess how these treatments affected the conditions in the DBL and the response of organisms to OA. Overall, low flow velocity did not ameliorate the negative effect of low pH and therefore did not provide a refugia from OA. Flow velocity had species-specific effects with positive effects on calcification for two species. pH in the calcifying fluid (pHcf) was reduced by low flow in both corals at low light only. pHcf was significantly impacted by pH in the DBL for the two species capable of significantly modifying pH in the DBL. The dissolved inorganic carbon in the calcifying fluid (DICcf) was highest under low pH for the corals and low flow for the coralline, while the saturation state in the calcifying fluid and its proxy (FWHM) were generally not affected by the treatments. This study therefore demonstrates that the effects of OA will manifest most severely in a combination of lower light and lower flow habitats for sub-tropical coralline algae. These effects will also be greatest in lower flow habitats for some corals. Together with existing literature, these findings reinforce that the effects of OA are highly context dependent, and will differ greatly between habitats, and depending on species composition.</abstract><research-notes>Comeau, S&#xD;Cornwall, C E&#xD;Pupier, C A&#xD;DeCarlo, T M&#xD;Alessi, C&#xD;Trehern, R&#xD;McCulloch, M T&#xD;eng&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't&#xD;England&#xD;Sci Rep. 2019 Sep 6;9(1):12829. doi: 10.1038/s41598-019-49044-w.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: The University of Western Australia, Oceans Graduate School and Oceans Institute, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley, 6009, Western Australia, Australia. comeau@obs-vlfr.fr.

Recent debate has focussed on the need to develop approaches to arrest the potential negative impacts of ocean acidification on ecosystems dominated by calcareous organisms. In this study, we demonstrate the role of a discrete (i.e. diffusion) boundary layer (DBL), formed at the surface of some calcifying species under slow flows, in buffering them from the corrosive effects of low pH seawater. The coralline macroalga Arthrocardia corymbosa was grown in a multifactorial experiment with two mean pH levels (8.05 'ambient' and 7.65 a worst case 'ocean acidification' scenario projected for 2100), each with two levels of seawater flow (fast and slow, i.e. DBL thin or thick). Coralline algae grown under slow flows with thick DBLs (i.e., unstirred with regular replenishment of seawater to their surface) maintained net growth and calcification at pH 7.65 whereas those in higher flows with thin DBLs had net dissolution. Growth under ambient seawater pH (8.05) was not significantly different in thin and thick DBL treatments. No other measured diagnostic (recruit sizes and numbers, photosynthetic metrics, %C, %N, %MgCO3) responded to the effects of reduced seawater pH. Thus, flow conditions that promote the formation of thick DBLs, may enhance the subsistence of calcifiers by creating localised hydrodynamic conditions where metabolic activity ameliorates the negative impacts of ocean acidification.</abstract><research-notes>Cornwall, Christopher E&#xD;Boyd, Philip W&#xD;McGraw, Christina M&#xD;Hepburn, Christopher D&#xD;Pilditch, Conrad A&#xD;Morris, Jaz N&#xD;Smith, Abigail M&#xD;Hurd, Catriona L&#xD;eng&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't&#xD;PLoS One. 2014 May 13;9(5):e97235. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0097235. eCollection 2014.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: Department of Botany, University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.

Despite intense research effort on coral reef calcium carbonate production, the inclusion of a key reef forming/accreting calcifying group, the crustose coralline algae, remains challenging both from a theoretical and practical standpoint. While corals are typically the primary reef builders of contemporary reefs, crustose coralline algae can contribute equally. Here, we combine several sets of data with numerical and theoretical modelling to demonstrate that crustose coralline algae carbonate production can match or even exceed the contribution of corals to reef carbonate production. Despite their importance, crustose coralline algae are often inaccurately recorded in benthic surveys or even entirely missing from coral reef carbonate budgets. We outline several recommendations to improve the inclusion of crustose coralline algae into such carbonate budgets under the ongoing climate crisis.</abstract><urls><text-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1038/s43247-023-00766-w</url><url>https://www.nature.com/articles/s43247-023-00766-w.pdf</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Cornwall, C.

We test whether exposure to greater pH variability enhances resistance to ocean acidification for the coral Goniopora sp. and coralline alga Hydrolithon reinboldii from two sites: one with low pH variability (less than 0.15 units daily; Shell Island) and a site with high pH variability (up to 1.4 pH units daily; Tallon Island). We grew populations of both species for more than 100 days under a combination of differing pH variability (high/low) and means (ambient pH 8.05/ocean acidification pH 7.65). Calcification rates of Goniopora sp. were unaffected by the examined variables. Calcification rates of H. reinboldii were significantly faster in Tallon than in Shell Island individuals, and Tallon Island individuals calcified faster in the high variability pH 8.05 treatment compared with all others. Geochemical proxies for carbonate chemistry within the calcifying fluid (cf) of both species indicated that only mean seawater pH influenced pHcf pH treatments had no effect on proxies for Omegacf These limited responses to extreme pH treatments demonstrate that some calcifying taxa may be capable of maintaining constant rates of calcification under ocean acidification by actively modifying Omegacf.</abstract><research-notes>Cornwall, C E&#xD;Comeau, S&#xD;DeCarlo, T M&#xD;Moore, B&#xD;D'Alexis, Q&#xD;McCulloch, M T&#xD;eng&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't&#xD;England&#xD;Proc Biol Sci. 2018 Aug 8;285(1884). pii: rspb.2018.1168. doi: 10.1098/rspb.2018.1168.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: Oceans Graduate School and Oceans Institute, The University of Western Australia, 35 Stirling Highway, Crawley 6009 Western Australia, Australia christopher.cornwall@vuw.ac.nz.

However, the mechanisms are uncertain, and the magnitude is species specific. Here, we assess whether species-specific responses to ocean acidification of coralline algae are related to differences in pH at the site of calcification within the calcifying fluid/medium (pHcf ) using delta(11) B as a proxy. Declines in delta(11) B for all three species are consistent with shifts in delta(11) B expected if B(OH)4(-) was incorporated during precipitation. In particular, the delta(11) B ratio in Amphiroa anceps was too low to allow for reasonable pHcf values if B(OH)3 rather than B(OH)4(-) was directly incorporated from the calcifying fluid. This points towards delta(11) B being a reliable proxy for pHcf for coralline algal calcite and that if B(OH)3 is present in detectable proportions, it can be attributed to secondary postincorporation transformation of B(OH)4(-) . We thus show that pHcf is elevated during calcification and that the extent is species specific. The net calcification of two species of coralline algae (Sporolithon durum, and Amphiroa anceps) declined under elevated CO2 , as did their pHcf . Neogoniolithon sp. had the highest pHcf , and most constant calcification rates, with the decrease in pHcf being (1/4) that of seawater pH in the treatments, demonstrating a control of coralline algae on carbonate chemistry at their site of calcification. The discovery that coralline algae upregulate pHcf under ocean acidification is physiologically important and should be included in future models involving calcification.</abstract><research-notes>Cornwall, Christopher E&#xD;Comeau, Steeve&#xD;McCulloch, Malcolm T&#xD;eng&#xD;England&#xD;Glob Chang Biol. 2017 Oct;23(10):4245-4256. doi: 10.1111/gcb.13673.

Calcareous organisms can be negatively affected by extreme changes in seawater pH (pH(sw)) such as this due to the associated changes in the oceanic carbonate system. The boron isotopic composition (delta(11) B) of biogenic carbonates has been previously used to monitor pH at the calcification site (pH(cf)) in scleractinian corals, providing mechanistic insights into coral biomineralisation and the impact of variable pH(sw) on this process. Motivated by these investigations, this study examines the delta(11) B of the high-Mg calcite skeleton of the coralline red alga Neogoniolithon sp. to constrain pH(cf), and investigates how this taxon's pH(cf) is impacted by ocean acidification. delta B-11 was measured in multiple algal replicates (n = 4-5) cultured at four different pCO(2) scenarios-averaging (+/- 1 sigma) 409 (+/- 6), 606 (+/- 7), 903 (+/- 12) and 2856 (+/- 54) mu atm, corresponding to average pH(sw) (+/- 1 sigma) of 8.19 (+/- 0.03), 8.05 (+/- 0.06), 7.91 (+/- 0.03) and 7.49 (+/- 0.02) respectively. Results show that skeletal delta(11) B is elevated relative to the delta(11) B of seawater borate at all pH(sw) treatments by up to 18%. Although substantial variability in delta(11) B exists between replicate samples cultured at a given pH(sw) (smallest range = 2.32% at pHsw 8.19, largest range = 6.08% at pH(sw) 7.91), strong correlations are identified between delta(11) B and pH(sw) (R-2 = 0.72, p &lt; 0.0001, n = 16) and between delta(11) B and B/Ca (R-2 = 0.72, p &lt; 0.0001, n = 16). Assuming that skeletal delta(11) B reflects pH(cf) as previously observed for scleractinian corals, the average pH(cf) across all experiments was 1.20 pH units (0.79 to 1.56) higher than pH(sw), with the magnitude of this offset varying parabolically with decreasing pH(sw), with a maximum difference between pH(sw) and pH(cf) at a pH(sw) of 7.91. Observed relationships between pH(sw) and calcification rate, and between pH(sw) and pH(cf), suggest that coralline algae exhibit some resilience to moderate ocean acidification via increase of pH(cf) relative to pH(sw) in a similar manner to scleractinian corals. However, these results also indicate that pH(cf) cannot be sufficiently increased by algae exposed to a larger reduction in pH(sw), adversely impacting calcification rates of coralline red algae.

Abundant and ecologically important coralline algae may be particularly susceptible to OA; however, multi-stressor studies and those on articulated morphotypes are lacking. Here, we use field observations and laboratory experiments to elucidate the impacts of warming and acidification on growth, calcification, mineralogy, and photophysiology of the temperate articulated coralline alga, Calliarthron tuberculosum. We conducted a 4-week fully factorial mesocosm experiment exposing individuals from a southern CA kelp forest to current and future temperature and pH/pCO2 conditions (+2°C, −0.5 pH units). Calcification was reduced under warming (70%) and further reduced by high pCO2 or high pCO2 x warming (~150%). Growth (change in linear extension and surface area) was reduced by warming (40% and 50%, respectively), high pCO2 (20% and 40%, respectively), and high pCO2 x warming (50% and 75%, respectively). The maximum photosynthetic rate (Pmax) increased by 100% under high pCO2 conditions, but we did not detect an effect of pCO2 or warming on photosynthetic efficiency (α). We also did not detect the effect of warming or pCO2 on mineralogy. However, variation in Mg incorporation in cell walls of different cell types (i.e., higher mol % Mg in cortical vs. medullary) was documented for the first time in this species. These results support findings from a growing body of literature suggesting that coralline algae are often more negatively impacted by warming than OA, with the potential for antagonistic effects when factors are combined. © 2022 The Authors.

The susceptibility of CCA to increasing ocean pCO(2) and declining pH or ocean acidification (OA) is a growing concern. Although CCA are autotrophs, there has been little focus on the interaction of elevated pCO(2) and irradiance. We examined elevated pCO(2) effects on individual CCA and macroalgal benthic communities at high and low irradiance (205 13 mol photons m(-2) s(-1)) in an aquaria experiment (35 d, June August 2014) on Little Cayman Island, Caribbean. A dominant Cayman reef wall CCA (Peyssonnelia sp.) in its adult lobed form and individual CCA recruits were used as experimental units. Changes in CCA, fleshy macroalgae (branching and turfs), and microalgae (including microbial biofilm) per cent cover and frequency were examined on macroalgal communities that settled onto plates from the reef. Reef diel cycles of pCO(2) and pH were simulated using seawater inflow from a back reef. Although CO2 enrichment to year 2100 levels resulted in 1087 mu atm pCO(2) in the elevated pCO(2) treatment, CaCO3 saturation states remained high (Omega(cal) &gt;= 2.7). Under these conditions, elevated pCO(2) had no effect on Peyssonnelia sp. calcification rates or survival regardless of irradiance. Individual CCA surface area on the bottom of settling plates was lower under elevated pCO(2), but per cent cover or frequency within the community was unchanged. In contrast, there was a strong and consistent community assemblage response to irradiance. Microalgae increased at high irradiance and CCA increased under low irradiance with no significant pCO(2) interaction. Based on this short-term experiment, tropical macroalgal communities are unlikely to shift at pCO(2) levels predicted for year 2100 under high or low irradiance. Rather, irradiance and other factors that promote microalgae are likely to be strong drivers of tropical benthic algal community structure under climate change.</abstract><research-notes>Df2ar&#xD;Times Cited:5&#xD;Cited References Count:64&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: Florida Atlantic Univ, Dept Biol Sci, 777 Glades Rd, Boca Raton, FL 33431 USA Cent Caribbean Marine Inst, US POB 1461, Princeton 08542, NJ USA Little Cayman Res Ctr, North Coast Rd,Box 37, Little Cayman KY32501, Cayman Islands, England Kean Univ, Sch Environm &amp; Sustainabil Sci, 1000 Morris Ave, Union, NJ 07083 USA&#xD;alt-title: Ices J Mar Sci&#xD;accession-num: WOS:000371142000029</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>https://watermark.silverchair.com/fsv213.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAArUwggKxBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKiMIICngIBADCCApcGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMtLuK1k71oaiOX5atAgEQgIICaOlXFQtqArYYhJx5zfULb9kYJlRunt5nXcY9qm8lDkU86LSE2flH4u1lozg15FiF7SQECNQKu80_DDKJliG6gFRAoUoYI-C72hMIkxrPNWrbw0HBEt9X7ipw0WKyO56o0iwo61kl6SWqA6OanBRxr2mXxGUn8sCBzDo2vDQmVJYNicr7o5FU5mshqdSIBqb8PSXEiXw57dKqEMUpcdiNUI4cO05zzPMK9g08hcHf4hdI_dYmK30OxWY5npUhC8SSaC58ST64gpmwm8Hmfa6gx-gM_HGLtWRb61ySycqqenjROCvuAgzQEtm4WXE8c0jiYZ2VU5xUVbnsC8tRlVpWrSo83dNCZtRWDW8cAKZ06uH3Ow6wrAmmgJFrpyMwl2mSfhfK4mbv0Uc14JkyyFJt2sCfyrB4yi7BO_XoZYUw1WomDo_Nig0DOfueHUZr4XCY8Q5kogbItsphpFA-iQCOWtrjyDjw6P0r_8kQ8jE4B-YeiSR2lbh26fq_ETjK9FrYZCIo8Cc4lP7-fnDF8qe9VQbfI3h196gBGnFZKi484l_EYFgO6DO_Wq8YVZ1ARLaOMAT6ZHipuTx2cm9ZTmkOed51M6u_ldjG7LobcOz2eSew5gCsUaj0R6KN_YpvlYrVazy7sckY7zYm83KVtrNWFHaX7Ka61gBri_ci2Wu2FEK2FNt_UzaDnhwcBx4BquCc5JXuvJg9RUBktePh6jU5Gmvv7B_zCin8mPW9LIHd-rmr0096Jr4pg76V6zh04gVpoRh3JENSEPzZp3xG6MMDB0GGuNLZQzz5-t3fjQ3UY8JLzxdFqjaEmK4</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Eakin, C.

To test this hypothesis, the effect of elevated pCO(2) was investigated in the articulated coralline red alga Corallina elongata from an intertidal rock pool on the north coast of Brittany (France), where pCO(2) naturally varied daily between 70 and 1000 mu atm. Metabolism was measured on algae in the laboratory after they had been grown for 3 weeks at pCO(2) concentrations of 380, 550, 750 and 1000 mu atm. Net and gross primary production, respiration and calcification rates were assessed by measurements of oxygen and total alkalinity fluxes using incubation chambers in the light and dark. Calcite mol % Mg/Ca (mMg/Ca) was analysed in the tips, branches and basal parts of the fronds, as well as in new skeletal structures produced by the algae in the different pCO(2) treatments. Respiration, gross primary production and calcification in light and dark were not significantly affected by increased pCO(2). Algae grown under elevated pCO(2) (550, 750 and 1000 mu atm) formed fewer new structures and produced calcite with a lower mMg/Ca ratio relative to those grown under 380 mu atm. This study supports the assumption that C. elongata from a tidal pool, where pCO(2) fluctuates over diel and seasonal cycles, is relatively robust to elevated pCO(2) compared to other recently investigated coralline algae.</abstract><research-notes>Sp.

The main species involved in building these reefs are two species of intertidal vermetid gastropods and the crustose calcareous alga, Neogoniolithon brassica-florida, which cements the gastropod shells and thus solidifying the reef edges. In the present study, we examined the pattern of distribution in the field and the environmental sensitivity (thermal tolerance, resilience to low pH, high light intensity and desiccation) of N. brassica-florida along the coasts of Sicily and Israel by means of chlorophyll fluorescence and total alkalinity measurements in situ and in the laboratory. Tidal regimes did not affect photosynthesis of N. brassica-florida but light intensity in the intertidal did. Sensitivity to increased light intensity was amplified by elevated temperature and reduced pH. Winter temperature above 16 degrees C caused a decrease in the photosynthetic performance of photo-system II. Similarly, a decrease in pH resulted in decreased maximum photosynthetic yield and electron transport rate. Calcification was significantly lower at pH 7.9 as compared with ambient (8.1) pH. In fact, dissolution at pH 7.9 at night was higher than net calcification during the day, suggesting that N. brassica-florida may not be able to contribute to reef accretion under the levels of seawater warming and ocean acidification projected by the end of this century.</abstract><research-notes>Ez1dp&#xD;Times Cited:5&#xD;Cited References Count:52&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: Bar Ilan Univ, Mina &amp; Everard Goodman Fac Life Sci, IL-52900 Ramat Gan, Israel Interuniv Inst Marine Sci, POB 469, IL-88103 Elat, Israel Univ Haifa, Leon Charney Sch Marine Sci, IL-31905 Har Hakarmel, Israel Univ Palermo, CoNISMa, Dept Earth &amp; Marine Sci, Via Archirafi 28, I-90123 Palermo, Italy&#xD;alt-title: Ices J Mar Sci&#xD;accession-num: WOS:000404450100019</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>https://watermark.silverchair.com/fsw167.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAArYwggKyBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggKjMIICnwIBADCCApgGCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMJbPZk6NHsYKdTK4_AgEQgIICaSd_jvRilcMpFgQOsliO_ODTFR7agX6jcT2f4wLOvHS8iB6DscmEf6MO2SHeNZmDnEHgSa2ZuizGrbR1YHde68cxKQ1vAntYtyw1PrxFnqnZ4pDFfOLvOk-BZRi1b5b0YzjP9PGYNq1h4ucQM2mLKnWZxdw-rQqotpSs5P92-dlp0UHH41DEZG6uXaskaU4UmRih-m_M6NLMDgJ0FTNCEANS9aFBVxm1J2I3fjU5d-tk5qy7Iooo6CMilbJyKe9e1CgN_GNX-xEhSFSwWltjArRmUaWDUUGT39DkBV5bR-EK7QVd-rCKeeix-2fRsGvzovW86reOdQJ16fL_FfqUw_OrmJxu_fPMO1jQZrgjECfmt4jD9Q1rKR9eH_8yDfyo-DYmcby2OuoSfe1Svex9QiKa0JN-I8ZyzB_nLnRiSpNrlMxWBbhXYNZY-hRUnlOlWhZW25iS83K_AwpiPmYzLNPwDgR6yPV9p27cvcnrxddlXpB2QfUeedW5tz_pDs582RtpfM7OEvCfBekVePyf3xFQx8grNlptVV8QYqioSjmcYviwX5Po-DMP4zq0vVQ2rkQ_hk5YIgr3I0Nqtg5VrqFgL8lZ8MUkpY_PfIdX7aQwj3GZoW61bYM1seU2GrNiLPdZI-GmLcynHi_iMgriv7Fxa6cSKldqHugSpBsl5CR_hXZ8c9qpOCFGydFDeEVueBPD_oQ-pA_N4JgEQo4BizZXZWVI3dsmdH4b_yPuMbKe_8KzGSqaMLenv_JiMNbCQl3DCzUNEaHs6jiec5HHG00uXdj-uLC0-1Xt9qxmSOlU-SzeYNnA-t1-</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Freiwald, A.</author><author>Henrich, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Reefal coralline algal build-ups within the Arctic Circle: morphology and sedimentary dynamics under extreme environmental seasonality</title><secondary-title>Sedimentology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Sedimentology</full-title></periodical><pages>963-984</pages><volume>41</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>1994</year><pub-dates><date>1994/10/01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0037-0746</isbn><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1994.tb01435.x</electronic-resource-num><abstract>ABSTRACT Carbonate frameworks secreted by phototrophic organisms within the Arctic Circle are not well documented. Underwater surveys of the inner-shelf off Troms, northern Norway (70°N), reveal extended fixed algal build-ups which are fringed by rhodolith belts affected by storms. Reefal growth by coralline algae under temperature and light regimes of extreme seasonality is made possible because of a decoupling of carbon fixation during summer and utilization of stored carbon during the period of winter darkness. Although the annual growth of the framework constructing algae is comparatively low, the annual carbonate production rate is similar to subtropical-tropical counterparts because of a remarkably high standing stock. Early diagenetic alteration is restricted to intraparticle cementation processes which start in vivo. Bioerosional destruction is the dominant control on the preservation of high latitude build-ups. Preservation of Holocene autochthonous coralline algal biostromes is enhanced by rapid burial during storm events. Redeposition during storms is the most important process in forming a distinct sedimentary facies zonation.</abstract><research-notes>The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;publisher: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1365-3091.1994.tb01435.x</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gao, K.

However, little is known regarding how calcifying algae respond to solar UV radiation (UVR, UVA+UVB, 280-400 nm). UVR may act synergistically, antagonistically or independently with ocean acidification (high CO2/low pH of seawater) to affect their calcification processes. We cultured the articulated coralline alga Corallina sessilis Yendo at 380 ppmv (low) and 1000 ppmv (high) CO2 levels while exposing the alga to solar radiation treatments with or without UVR. The presence of UVR inhibited the growth, photosynthetic O-2 evolution and calcification rates by13%, 6% and 3% in the low and by 47%, 20% and 8% in the high CO2 concentrations, respectively, reflecting a synergistic effect of CO2 enrichment with UVR. UVR induced significant decline of pH in the CO2-enriched cultures. The contents of key photosynthetic pigments, chlorophyll a and phycobiliproteins decreased, while UV-absorptivity increased under the high pCO(2)/low pH condition. Nevertheless, UV-induced inhibition of photosynthesis increased when the ratio of particulate inorganic carbon/particulate organic carbon decreased under the influence of CO2-acidified seawater, suggesting that the calcified layer played a UV-protective role. Both UVA and UVB negatively impacted photosynthesis and calcification, but the inhibition caused by UVB was about 2.5-2.6 times that caused by UVA. The results imply that coralline algae suffer from more damage caused by UVB as they calcify less and less with progressing ocean acidification.</abstract><research-notes>619qd&#xD;Times Cited:135&#xD;Cited References Count:55&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: Xiamen Univ, State Key Lab Marine Environm Sci, Xiamen 361005, Peoples R China Chinese Acad Fisheries Sci, E China Sea Fisheries Res Inst, Minist Agr, Key Lab Marine &amp; Estuarine Fisheries Resources &amp;, Shanghai 200090, Peoples R China&#xD;alt-title: Global Change Biol&#xD;accession-num: WOS:000279443800020</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.02113.x</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Gherardi, Douglas</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Community structure and carbonate production of a temperate rhodolith bank from Arvoredo Island, Southern Brazil</title><secondary-title>Brazilian Journal of Oceanography</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Brazilian Journal of Oceanography</full-title></periodical><volume>52</volume><dates><year>2004</year><pub-dates><date>12/01 2004</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1590/S1679-87592004000300004</electronic-resource-num><urls><text-urls><url>https://www.scielo.br/j/bjoce/a/ZJLMYC4wyhSfWLHWgV9scXQ/?lang=en&amp;format=pdf</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Graba-Landry, A.</author><author>Hoey, A.

Although climate change has been identified as a major threat to the persistence of macroalgal beds, the combined effects of ocean warming and ocean acidification on algal performance are poorly understood. Here we investigate the effects of increased temperature and acidification on the growth, calcification and nutritional content of 6 common subtropical macroalgae; Sargassum linearifolium, Ulva sp., Amphiroa anceps, Corallina officinalis, Delisea pulchra and Laurencia decussata. Algae were reared in a factorial cross of 3 temperatures (23 degrees C [ambient], 26 degrees C and 28 degrees C) and 3 pH levels (8.1 [ambient], 7.8 and 7.6) for 2 wk. The highest (28 degrees C) temperature decreased the growth of all 6 macroalgal species, irrespective of the pH levels. In contrast, the effect of decreased pH on growth was variable. The growth of Ulva sp. and C. officinalis increased, L. decussata decreased, while the remaining 3 species were unaffected. Interestingly, the differential responses of macroalgae to ocean acidification were unrelated to whether or not a species was a calcifying alga, or their carbon-uptake mechanism - 2 processes that are predicted to be sensitive to decreased pH. The growth of the calcifying algae (C. officinalis and A. anceps) was not affected by reduced pH but calcification of these 2 algae was reduced when exposed to a combination of reduced pH and elevated temperature. The 3 species capable of uptake of bicarbonate, S. linearifolium, L. decussata and Ulva sp., displayed positive, negative and neutral changes in growth, respectively, in response to reduced pH. The C:N ratio for 5 of the 6 species was unaffected by either pH or temperature. The consistent and predictable negative effects of temperature on the growth and calcification of subtropical macroalgae suggests that this stressor poses a greater threat to the persistence of subtropical macroalgal populations than ocean acidification under ongoing and future climate change.</abstract><research-notes>Gg2vv&#xD;Times Cited:7&#xD;Cited References Count:110&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: Southern Cross Univ, Natl Marine Sci Ctr, POB J321, Coffs Harbour, NSW 2450, Australia James Cook Univ, ARC Ctr Excellence Coral Reef Studies, Townsville, Qld 4811, Australia Univ Virgin Isl, Ctr Marine &amp; Environm Studies, St Thomas, VI 00802 USA Univ New South Wales, Sch Biol Earth &amp; Environm Sci, Evolut &amp; Ecol Res Ctr, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia Univ Sydney, Sch Med Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia Univ Sydney, Sch Life &amp; Environm Sci, Sydney, NSW 2006, Australia&#xD;alt-title: Mar Ecol Prog Ser&#xD;accession-num: WOS:000432551900005</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2018/595/m595p055.pdf</url><url>http://www.int-res.com/abstracts/meps/v595/p55-69/</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Guenther, R.</author><author>Porcher, E.

Calcifying organisms are sensitive to elevated CO2 concentrations due to their calcium carbonate skeletons. In temperate rocky intertidal environments, calcifying and noncalcifying macroalgae make up diverse benthic photoautotrophic communities. These communities may change as calcifiers and noncalcifiers respond differently to rising CO2 concentrations. In order to test this hypothesis, we conducted an 86 d mesocosm experiment to investigate the physiological and competitive responses of calcifying and noncalcifying temperate marine macroalgae to 385, 665, and 1486 mu atm CO2. We focused on comparing 2 abundant red algae in the Northeast Atlantic: Corallina officinalis (calcifying) and Chondrus crispus (noncalcifying). We found an interactive effect of CO2 concentration and exposure time on growth rates of C. officinalis, and total protein and carbohydrate concentrations in both species. Photosynthetic rates did not show a strong response. Calcification in C. officinalis showed a parabolic response, while skeletal inorganic carbon decreased with increasing CO2. Community structure changed, as Chondrus crispus cover increased in all treatments, while C. officinalis cover decreased in both elevated-CO2 treatments. Photochemical parameters of other species are also presented. Our results suggest that CO2 will alter the competitive strengths of calcifying and noncalcifying temperate benthic macroalgae, resulting in different community structures, unless these species are able to adapt at a rate similar to or faster than the current rate of increasing sea-surface CO2 concentrations.</abstract><research-notes>010wp&#xD;Times Cited:44&#xD;Cited References Count:53&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: Univ Bremen, Bremen Marine Ecol Ctr Res &amp; Educ, D-28359 Bremen, Germany&#xD;alt-title: Mar Ecol Prog Ser&#xD;accession-num: WOS:000309125500006</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>https://www.int-res.com/articles/meps2012/464/m464p089.pdf</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>James, R.

However, many CCA exist in habitats where diel cycles in pH can surpass near-future OA projections. The prevailing theory that natural variability increases the tolerance of calcifiers to OA has not been widely tested with tropical CCA. Here, we assess the response of the reef-building species Lithophyllum congestum to stable and variable pH treatments, including an ambient control (amb/stable). The amb/variable treatment simulated an ambient diel cycle in pH (7.65-7.95), OA/stable simulated constant low pH reflecting worst-case year 2100 predictions (7.7), and OA/variable combined diel cycling with lower mean pH (7.45-7.75). We monitored the effects of pH on total calcification rate and photophysiology (maximum quantum yield) over 16 weeks. To assess the potential for acclimatization, we also quantified calcification rates during the first (0-8 weeks), and second (8-16 weeks) halves of the experiment. Calcification rates were lower in all pH treatments relative to ambient controls and photophysiology was unaffected. At the end of the 16-week experiment, total calcification rates were similarly low in the amb/variable and OA/stable treatment (27-29%), whereas rates declined by double in the OA/variable treatment (60%). When comparing the first and second halves of the experiment, there was no acclimatization in stable treatments as calcification rates remained unchanged in both the amb/stable and OA/stable treatments. In contrast, calcification rates deteriorated between periods in the variable treatments: from a 16-47% reduction in the amb/variable treatment to a 49-79% reduction in the OA/variable treatment, relative to controls. Our findings provide compelling evidence that pH variability can heighten CCA sensitivity to reductions in pH. Moreover, the decline in calcification rate over time directly contrasts prevailing theory that variability inherently increases organismal tolerances to low pH, and suggests that mechanisms of tolerance may become limited with increasing time of exposure.

Coral reefs are vulnerable to climate change yet few studies have explored the potential for interactive effects of warming temperature and OA on an important coral reef calcifier, crustose coralline algae (CCA). Coralline algae serve many important ecosystem functions on coral reefs and are one of the most sensitive organisms to ocean acidification. We investigated the effects of elevated pCO(2) and temperature on calcification of Hydrolithon onkodes, an important species of reef-building coralline algae, and the subsequent effects on susceptibility to grazing by sea urchins. H. onkodes was exposed to a fully factorial combination of pCO(2) (420, 530, 830 mu atm) and temperature (26, 29 degrees C) treatments, and calcification was measured by the change in buoyant weight after 21 days of treatment exposure. Temperature and pCO(2) had a significant interactive effect on net calcification of H. onkodes that was driven by the increased calcification response to moderately elevated pCO(2). We demonstrate that the CCA calcification response was variable and non-linear, and that there was a trend for highest calcification at ambient temperature. H. onkodes then was exposed to grazing by the sea urchin Echinothrix diadema, and grazing was quantified by the change in CCA buoyant weight from grazing trials. E. diadema removed 60% more CaCO3 from H. onkodes grown at high temperature and high pCO(2) than at ambient temperature and low pCO(2). The increased susceptibility to grazing in the high pCO(2) treatment is among the first evidence indicating the potential for cascading effects of OA and temperature on coral reef organisms and their ecological interactions.

Many coral reefs are dynamic with respect to carbonate chemistry, and experience fluctuations in pCO(2) that exceed OA projections for the near future. To understand the influence of dynamic pCO(2) on an important reef calcifier, we tested the response of the crustose coralline alga Porolithon onkodes to oscillating pCO(2). Individuals were exposed to ambient (400 microatm), high (660 microatm), or variable pCO(2) (oscillating between 400/660 microatm) treatments for 14 days. To explore the potential for coralline acclimatization, we collected individuals from low and high pCO(2) variability sites (upstream and downstream respectively) on a back reef characterized by unidirectional water flow in Moorea, French Polynesia. We quantified the effects of treatment on algal calcification by measuring the change in buoyant weight, and on algal metabolism by conducting sealed incubations to measure rates of photosynthesis and respiration. Net photosynthesis was higher in the ambient treatment than the variable treatment, regardless of habitat origin, and there was no effect on respiration or gross photosynthesis. Exposure to high pCO(2) decreased P. onkodes calcification by &gt;70%, regardless of the original habitat. In the variable treatment, corallines from the high variability habitat calcified 42% more than corallines from the low variability habitat. The significance of the original habitat for the coralline calcification response to variable, high pCO(2) indicates that individuals existing in dynamic pCO(2) habitats may be acclimatized to OA within the scope of in situ variability. These results highlight the importance of accounting for natural pCO(2) variability in OA manipulations, and provide insight into the potential for plasticity in habitat and species-specific responses to changing ocean chemistry.</abstract><research-notes>Johnson, Maggie D&#xD;Moriarty, Vincent W&#xD;Carpenter, Robert C&#xD;eng&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't&#xD;Research Support, U.S. Gov't, Non-P.H.S.&#xD;PLoS One. 2014 Feb 5;9(2):e87678. doi: 10.1371/journal.pone.0087678. eCollection 2014.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: Department of Biology, California State University, Northridge, California, United States of America.&#xD;edition: 2014/02/08&#xD;accession-num: 24505305</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24505305</url><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3914853/pdf/pone.0087678.pdf</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Johnson, M.

Algal responses to OA may vary because increasing CO2 has the potential to fertilize photosynthesis but impair biomineralization. Using a series of repeated experiments on Palmyra Atoll, simulated OA effects were tested across a suite of ecologically important coral reef algae, including five fleshy and six calcareous species. Growth, calcification and photophysiology were measured for each species independently and metrics were combined from each experiment using a meta-analysis to examine overall trends across functional groups categorized as fleshy, upright calcareous, and crustose coralline algae (CCA). The magnitude of the effect of OA on algal growth response varied by species, but the direction was consistent within functional groups. Exposure to OA conditions generally enhanced growth in fleshy macroalgae, reduced net calcification in upright calcareous algae, and caused net dissolution in CCA. Additionally, three of the five fleshy seaweeds tested became reproductive upon exposure to OA conditions. There was no consistent effect of OA on algal photophysiology. Our study provides experimental evidence to support the hypothesis that OA will reduce the ability of calcareous algae to biomineralize. Further, we show that CO2 enrichment either will stimulate population or somatic growth in some species of fleshy macroalgae. Thus, our results suggest that projected OA conditions may favor non-calcifying algae and influence the relative dominance of fleshy macroalgae on reefs, perpetuating or exacerbating existing shifts in reef community structure.</abstract><research-notes>Johnson, Maggie Dorothy&#xD;Price, Nichole N&#xD;Smith, Jennifer E&#xD;eng&#xD;PeerJ. 2014 May 27;2:e411. doi: 10.7717/peerj.411. eCollection 2014.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: Scripps Institution of Oceanography, La Jolla, CA, USA.&#xD;edition: 2014/06/12&#xD;accession-num: 24918033</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24918033</url><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4045329/pdf/peerj-02-411.pdf</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Kamenos, N.

However, empirical studies using stable endpoint pCO2 concentrations find species exhibit variable biological and geochemical responses rather than the expected negative patterns. In addition, the carbonate chemistry of many marine systems is now being observed to be more variable than previously thought. To underpin more robust projections of future OA impacts on marine biomineralisers and their role in ecosystem service provision, we investigate coralline algal responses to realistically variable scenarios of marine pCO2 enrichment. Coralline algae are important in ecosystem function; providing habitats and nursery areas, hosting high biodiversity, stabilizing reef structures and contributing to the carbon cycle. Red coralline marine algae were exposed for 80 days to one of three pH treatments: (i) current pH (control); (ii) low pH (7.7) representing OA change; and (iii) an abrupt drop to low pH (7.7) representing the higher rates of pH change observed at natural vent systems, in areas of upwelling and during CCS releases. We demonstrate that red coralline algae respond differently to the rate and the magnitude of pH change induced by pCO2 enrichment. At low pH, coralline algae survived by increasing their calcification rates. However, when the change to low pH occurred at a fast rate we detected, using Raman spectroscopy, weaknesses in the calcite skeleton, with evidence of dissolution and molecular positional disorder. This suggests that, while coralline algae will continue to calcify, they may be structurally weakened, putting at risk the ecosystem services they provide. Notwithstanding evolutionary adaptation, the ability of coralline algae to cope with OA may thus be determined primarily by the rate, rather than magnitude, at which pCO2 enrichment occurs.</abstract><research-notes>Kamenos, Nicholas A&#xD;Burdett, Heidi L&#xD;Aloisio, Elena&#xD;Findlay, Helen S&#xD;Martin, Sophie&#xD;Longbone, Charlotte&#xD;Dunn, Jonathan&#xD;Widdicombe, Stephen&#xD;Calosi, Piero&#xD;eng&#xD;Research Support, Non-U.S. Gov't&#xD;England&#xD;Glob Chang Biol. 2013 Dec;19(12):3621-8. doi: 10.1111/gcb.12351.

The success of the herbivorous juvenile stage of the crown-of-thorns starfish (COTS), Acanthaster planci, may be affected by the impacts of ocean conditions on its crustose coralline algal (CCA) food. To partition the direct effects of near future ocean acidification on juvenile COTS and indirect effects through changes in their CCA food, COTS were grown in three pHT levels (7.9, 7.8, 7.6) and fed CCA grown at similar pH levels. Consumption of CCA by COTS was bolstered when the COTS were grown in low pH and when they were fed CCA grown in low pH regardless of the pH in which the COTS were reared. COTS fed CCA grown at pH 7.6 grew fastest, but the pH/pCO2 that the COTS were reared in had no direct effect on growth. Ocean acidification conditions decreased the C : N ratio and carbonate levels in the CCA. Bolstered growth in COTS may be driven by enhanced palatability, increased nutritive state and reduced defences of their CCA food. These results indicate that near future acidification will increase the success of early juvenile COTS and boost recruitment into the coral-eating life stage.</abstract><research-notes>Kamya, Pamela Z&#xD;Byrne, Maria&#xD;Mos, Benjamin&#xD;Hall, Lauren&#xD;Dworjanyn, Symon A&#xD;eng&#xD;England&#xD;Proc Biol Sci. 2017 Jun 14;284(1856). pii: rspb.2017.0778. doi: 10.1098/rspb.2017.0778.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: National Marine Science Centre, Southern Cross University, Coffs Harbour, New South Wales, Australia.

However, little information is available on the response of marine benthic communities as a whole to predicted changes. Here, we experimentally examined the combined effects of temperature and partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)/increases on the response of maerl bed assemblages, composed of living and dead thalli of the free-living coralline alga Lithothamnion corallioides, epiphytic fleshy algae, and grazer species. Two 3month experiments were performed in the winter and summer seasons in mesocosms with four different combinations of pCO(2) (ambient and high pCO(2)/and temperature (ambient and +3 degrees C). The response of maerl assemblages was assessed using metabolic measurements at the species and assemblage scales. This study suggests that seasonal variability represents an important driver influencing the magnitude and the direction of species and community response to climate change. Gross primary production and respiration of assemblages was enhanced by high pCO(2) conditions in the summer. This positive effect was attributed to the increase in epiphyte biomass, which benefited from higher CO2 concentrations for growth and primary production. Conversely, high pCO(2) drastically decreased the calcification rates in assemblages. This response can be attributed to the decline in calcification rates of living L. corallioides due to acidification and increased dissolution of dead L. corallioides. Future changes in pCO(2) and temperature are likely to promote the development of non-calcifying algae to the detriment of the engineer species L. corallioides. The development of fleshy algae may be modulated by the ability of grazers to regulate epiphyte growth. However, our results suggest that predicted changes will negatively affect the metabolism of grazers and potentially their ability to control epiphyte abundance. We show here that the effects of pCO(2) and temperature on maerl bed communities were weakened when these factors were combined. This underlines the importance of examining multifactorial approaches and community-level processes, which integrate species interactions, to better understand the impact of global change on marine ecosystems.</abstract><research-notes>Fo1wu&#xD;Times Cited:8&#xD;Cited References Count:93&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: UPMC, Sorbonne Univ, Stn Biol, Pl Georges Teissier, F-29688 Roscoff, France CNRS, Stn Biol, Pl Georges Teissier, F-29688 Roscoff, France UBO, IUEM, Pl Nicolas Copernic, F-29280 Plouzane, France&#xD;alt-title: Biogeosciences&#xD;accession-num: WOS:000416560200002</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>https://www.biogeosciences.net/14/5359/2017/bg-14-5359-2017.pdf</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Legrand, E.</author><author>Riera, P.</author><author>Lutier, M.</author><author>Coudret, J.</author><author>Grall, J.</author><author>Martin, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Grazers increase the sensitivity of coralline algae to ocean acidification and warming</title><secondary-title>Journal of Sea Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Sea Research</full-title><abbr-1>J Sea Res</abbr-1></periodical><pages>1-7</pages><volume>148</volume><keywords><keyword>calcification</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>co2</keyword><keyword>assemblages</keyword><keyword>productivity</keyword><keyword>physiological-responses</keyword><keyword>global change</keyword><keyword>algal-herbivore interactions</keyword><keyword>calcareous algae</keyword><keyword>community structure</keyword><keyword>defenses</keyword><keyword>grazing</keyword><keyword>impacts</keyword><keyword>lithothamnion</keyword><keyword>sediments</keyword><keyword>selective herbivore</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>Jun 2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1385-1101</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.seares.2019.03.001</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Coralline algae are expected to be adversely impacted by ocean acidification and warming. Most research on these algae has involved experiments on isolated species, without considering species interactions, such as grazing. This myopic view is challenging because the impact of climate change on coralline algae will depend on the direct impacts on individual coralline species and the indirect effects of altered interactions with other species. Here, we tested the influence of grazing on the response of the coralline alga Lithothamnion corallioides to near-future ocean acidification and warming. Two three-month experiments were performed in the winter and summer seasons in mesocosms under crossed conditions of pCO(2) (ambient and high pCO(2)) and temperature (ambient and +3 degrees C) in the presence and absence of grazers. In the winter, L. corallioides photosynthesis decreased with rising temperature in the presence of grazers, while calcification increased. It is likely that increased calcification may act as a structural protection to prevent damage from grazing. However, increasing calcification rates in the presence of grazers may be detrimental to other physiological processes, such as photosynthesis. In the summer, L. corallioides primary production, respiration, and calcification were higher in the presence of grazers than in their absence. Light calcification rates were reduced under high pCO(2) in the presence of grazers only. Moreover, dark calcification rates were more adversely affected by pCO(2) increase in the presence of grazers. Through their feeding activity, grazers may alter the structural integrity of thalli and increase the sensitivity of coralline algae to ocean acidification. Our results indicate that both season and grazing play a key role in the response of L. corallioides to acidification and warming. Seasonal variations and species interactions are thus critical to consider to make ecologically relevant predictions of the effects of future environmental changes.</abstract><research-notes>Ib1sa&#xD;Times Cited:0&#xD;Cited References Count:52&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: Sorbonne Univ, CNRS, UMR7144, EFEB,Stn Biol Roscoff, F-29680 Roscoff, France UBO, IUEM, Pl Nicolas Copernic, F-29280 Plouzane, France&#xD;alt-title: J Sea Res&#xD;accession-num: WOS:000470043700001</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1385110118302272?via%3Dihub</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Manning, J.

Wound healing mechanisms in crustose coralline algae (CCA) are related to skeletal growth and net calcification rate. Ocean acidification (OA) is known to affect rates of net calcification in a number of calcifying organisms, including CCA. Reduced rates of net calcification in CCA are likely to alter wound healing, and thus affect the consequences of herbivore-CCA interactions on coral reefs. The response of the tropical CCA Porolithon onkodes to OA and artificial wounding was quantified in a 51-day laboratory experiment. Eight artificially wounded (cut to a mean depth of 182 mu m) and eight non-wounded samples of P. onkodes were randomly placed into each of four treatments (n = 64 samples total). Each treatment was maintained at a different pCO(2) level representative of either ambient conditions or end-of-the-century, predicted conditions (IPCC, 2014); 429.31 +/- 20.84 (ambient), 636.54 +/- 27.29 (RCP4.5), 827.33 +/- 38.51 (RCP6.0), and 1179.39 +/- 88.85 mu atm (RCP8.5; mean +/- standard error). Elevated pCO(2) significantly reduced rates of net calcification in both wounded and non-wounded samples of P. onkodes (slopes = -6.4 x 10(-4) and - 5.5 x 10(-4) mg cm(-2) d(-1) per mu atm pCO(2), respectively over 51 days). There also was a significant reduction in the rate of vertical regeneration of thallus tissue within the wounds as pCO(2) increased (slope = -1.5 x 10(-3) mu m d(-1) per mu atm pCO(2) over 51 days). This study provides evidence that elevated pCO(2) could reduce the ability of this important alga to recover from wounding. Because wounding by herbivores plays an important role in determining CCA community structure, we propose reduced wound healing as a mechanism by which OA might affect the structure and functional roles of CCA communities on coral reefs.</abstract><research-notes>Jd5tm&#xD;Times Cited:0&#xD;Cited References Count:76&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Biol, Northridge, CA 91330 USA Calif State Univ Northridge, Dept Geol Sci, Northridge, CA 91330 USA&#xD;alt-title: J Exp Mar Biol Ecol&#xD;accession-num: WOS:000490045300009</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022098119300863?via%3Dihub</url><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0022098119300863?via%3Dihub</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martin, Sophie</author><author>Castets, Marie-Dorothée</author><author>Clavier, Jacques</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Primary production, respiration and calcification of the temperate free-living coralline alga Lithothamnion corallioides</title><secondary-title>Aquatic Botany</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Aquatic Botany</full-title></periodical><pages>121-128</pages><volume>85</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><keywords><keyword>Respiration</keyword><keyword>Calcification</keyword><keyword>Carbon budget</keyword><keyword>Coralline algae</keyword><keyword>Primary production</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2006</year><pub-dates><date>2006/08/01/</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0304-3770</isbn><electronic-resource-num>https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aquabot.2006.02.005</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Calcification and primary production responses to irradiance in the temperate coralline alga Lithothamnion corallioides were measured in summer 2004 and winter 2005 in the Bay of Brest. Coralline algae were incubated in dark and clear bottles exposed to different irradiances. Net primary production reached 1.5μmolCg−1drywth−1 in August and was twice as high as in January–February. Dark respiration showed significant seasonal variations, being three-fold higher in summer. Maximum calcification varied from 0.6μmolg−1drywth−1 in summer 2004 to 0.4μmolg−1drywth−1 in winter 2005. According to P–E curves and the daily course of irradiance, estimated daily net production and calcification reached 131μgCg−1drywt and 970μgCaCO3g−1drywt in summer 2004, and 36μgCg−1drywt and 336μgCaCO3g−1drywt in winter 2005. The net primary production of natural L. corallioides populations in shallow waters was estimated at 10–600gCm−2y−1, depending on depth and algal biomass. The mean annual calcification of L. corallioides populations varied from 300 to 3000gCaCO3m−2. These results are similar to those reported for tropical coralline algae in terms of carbon and carbonate productivity. Therefore, L. corallioides can be considered as a key element of carbon and carbonate cycles in the shallow coastal waters where they live.</abstract><urls><text-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0304377006000349</url><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304377006000349?via%3Dihub</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martin, Sophie</author><author>Charnoz, Amelie</author><author>Gattuso, Jean-Pierre</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Photosynthesis, respiration and calcification of the Mediterranean crustose coralline alga Lithophyllum cabiochae (Corallinales, Rhodophyta)</title><secondary-title>European Journal of Phycology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>European Journal of Phycology</full-title></periodical><pages>163-172</pages><volume>48</volume><dates><year>2013</year><pub-dates><date>05/01 2013</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1080/09670262.2013.786790</electronic-resource-num></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Martin, S.</author><author>Cohu, S.</author><author>Vignot, C.</author><author>Zimmerman, G.</author><author>Gattuso, J.

Algae were maintained in aquaria during 1 year at near-ambient conditions of irradiance, at ambient or elevated temperature (+3 degrees C), and at ambient (ca. 400 muatm) or elevated pCO2 (ca. 700 muatm). Respiration, photosynthesis, and net calcification showed a strong seasonal pattern following the seasonal variations of temperature and irradiance, with higher rates in summer than in winter. Respiration was unaffected by pCO2 but showed a general trend of increase at elevated temperature at all seasons, except in summer under elevated pCO2. Conversely, photosynthesis was strongly affected by pCO2 with a decline under elevated pCO2 in summer, autumn, and winter. In particular, photosynthetic efficiency was reduced under elevated pCO2. Net calcification showed different responses depending on the season. In summer, net calcification increased with rising temperature under ambient pCO2 but decreased with rising temperature under elevated pCO2. Surprisingly, the highest rates in summer were found under elevated pCO2 and ambient temperature. In autumn, winter, and spring, net calcification exhibited a positive or no response at elevated temperature but was unaffected by pCO2. The rate of calcification of L. cabiochae was thus maintained or even enhanced under increased pCO2. However, there is likely a trade-off with other physiological processes. For example, photosynthesis declines in response to increased pCO2 under ambient irradiance. The present study reports only on the physiological response of healthy specimens to ocean warming and acidification, however, these environmental changes may affect the vulnerability of coralline algae to other stresses such as pathogens and necroses that can cause major dissolution, which would have critical consequence for the sustainability of coralligenous habitats and the budgets of carbon and calcium carbonate in coastal Mediterranean ecosystems.</abstract><research-notes>Martin, Sophie&#xD;Cohu, Stephanie&#xD;Vignot, Celine&#xD;Zimmerman, Guillaume&#xD;Gattuso, Jean-Pierre&#xD;eng&#xD;England&#xD;Ecol Evol. 2013 Mar;3(3):676-93. doi: 10.1002/ece3.475.

Algae were maintained in aquaria during 1 year at near-ambient conditions of irradiance, at ambient or elevated temperature (+3 degrees C) and at ambient [ca. 400 parts per million (ppm)] or elevated pCO(2) (ca. 700 ppm). Algal necroses appeared at the end of summer under elevated temperature first at 700 ppm (60% of the thallus surface) and then at 400 ppm (30%). The death of algae was observed only under elevated temperature and was two- to threefold higher under elevated pCO(2). During the first month of the experiment, net calcification was significantly reduced under elevated pCO(2). At the end of the summer period, net calcification decreased by 50% when both temperature and pCO(2) were elevated while no effect was found under elevated temperature and elevated pCO(2) alone. In autumn and winter, net calcification in healthy algae increased with increasing temperature, independently of the pCO(2) level, while necroses and death in the algal population caused a net dissolution at elevated temperature and pCO(2). The dissolution of dead algal thalli was affected by elevated pCO(2), being two- to fourfold higher than under ambient pCO(2). These results suggest that net dissolution is likely to exceed net calcification in L. cabiochae by the end of this century. This could have major consequences in terms of biodiversity and biogeochemistry in coralligenous communities dominated by these algae.</abstract><research-notes>466xl&#xD;Times Cited:261&#xD;Cited References Count:58&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: CNRS, Lab Oceanog Villefranche sur Mer, F-06234 Villefranche Sur Mer, France Univ Paris 06, Lab Oceanog Villefranche sur Mer, F-06230 Villefranche Sur Mer, France&#xD;alt-title: Global Change Biol&#xD;accession-num: WOS:000267698400018</research-notes><language>English</language><urls><text-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/j.1365-2486.2009.01874.x</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Matsuda, S.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Succession and growth-rates of encrusting crustose coralline algae (rhodophyta, cryptonemiales) in the upper fore-reef environment off ishigaki-island, ryukyu-islands</title><secondary-title>Coral Reefs</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Coral Reefs</full-title></periodical><pages>185-195</pages><volume>7</volume><number>4</number><issue>4</issue><dates><year>1989</year><pub-dates><date>1989</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0722-4028</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/bf00301597</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>Matsuda, s&#xD;1432-0975&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;accession-num: WOS:A1989R941600005</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00301597</url><url>https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00301597.pdf</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>McNicholl, C.</author><author>Koch, M.

The elevated pCO(2) effects were examined in three coralline algal species living in contrasting habitats from intertidal to subtidal zones on the north-western coast of Brittany, France: (i) Corallina elongata, a branched alga found in tidal rock pools, (ii) Lithophyllum incrustans, a crustose coralline alga from the low intertidal zone, and (iii) Lithothamnion corallioides (maerl), a free-living form inhabiting the subtidal zone. Metabolic rates were assessed on specimens grown for one month at varying pCO(2): 380 (current pCO(2)), 550, 750 and 1000 mu atm (elevated pCO(2)). There was no pCO(2) effect on gross production in C. elongata and L. incrustans but L. incrustans respiration strongly increased with elevated pCO(2). L corallioides gross production slightly increased at 1000 mu atm, while respiration remained unaffected. Calcification rates decreased with pCO(2) in L. incrustans (both in the light and dark) and L. corallioides (only in the light), while C. elongata calcification was unaffected. This was consistent with the lower skeletal mMg/Ca ratio of C. elongata (0.17) relative to the two other species (0.20). L. incrustans had a higher occurrence of bleaching that increased with increasing pCO(2). pCO(2) could indirectly impact this coralline species physiology making them more sensitive to other stresses such as diseases or pathogens. These results underlined that the physiological response of coralline algae to near-future ocean acidification is species-specific and that species experiencing naturally strong pH variations were not necessarily more resistant to elevated pCO(2) than species from more stable environment.

Its growth rate was measured monthly in situ during one year. Growth rates were obtained by an adaptation of the buoyant weight technique. The highest daily growth rate was observed in July and reached 0.26 % d−1 (S.D. = 0.06), when expressed as the increase of calcium carbonate weight. The average daily growth rate was 0.12% d−1 (S.D. = 0.04) for a period of 275 days (summer and autumn 1988, winter 1989). Using this preliminary data, the calcium carbonate accretion rate can be estimated provisionally: 876 g m−2 year−1, a rate much lower than that of tropical reef coralline algae, but higher than that of Lithophyllum incrustans, the well known temperate European reef-builder.</abstract><urls><text-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00040243</url><url>https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00040243</url><url>https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/BF00040243.pdf</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Pulecio-Plaza, L.</author><author>Diaz-Pulido, G.</author><author>Garcia-Urueña, R.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonal upwelling conditions promote growth and calcification in reef-building coralline algae</title><secondary-title>Journal of Phycology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Journal of Phycology</full-title></periodical><pages>908-925</pages><volume>59</volume><number>5</number><issue>5</issue><dates><year>2023</year><pub-dates><date>Oct 2023</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>0022-3646</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1111/jpy.13370</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>Pulecio-Plaza, Lauri Diaz-Pulido, Guillermo Garcia-Uruena, Rocio&#xD;Garcia-Uruena, Rocio del Pilar/0000-0002-9667-3386; Diaz-Pulido, Guillermo/0000-0002-0901-3727&#xD;1529-8817&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;accession-num: WOS:001051059100001</research-notes></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Ragazzola, F.</author><author>Marchini, A.</author><author>Adani, M.</author><author>Bordone, A.</author><author>Castelli, A.</author><author>Cerrati, G.</author><author>Kolzenburg, R.</author><author>Langeneck, J.</author><author>di Marzo, C.</author><author>Nannini, M.</author><author>Raiteri, G.</author><author>Romanelli, E.</author><author>Santos, M.</author><author>Vasapollo, C.</author><author>Pipitone, C.</author><author>Lombardi, C.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>An intertidal life: Combined effects of acidification and winter heatwaves on a coralline alga (Ellisolandia elongata) and its associated invertebrate community</title><secondary-title>Marine Environmental Research</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Marine Environmental Research</full-title></periodical><volume>169</volume><dates><year>2021</year><pub-dates><date>2021</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.1016/j.marenvres.2021.105342</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>Export Date: 26 July 2021&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;work-type: Article</research-notes><remote-database-name>Scopus</remote-database-name><urls><text-urls><url>https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85105315365&amp;doi=10.1016%2fj.marenvres.2021.105342&amp;partnerID=40&amp;md5=4d5349d9f640cea3b061d20c6d86c57b</url><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0141113621000982?via%3Dihub</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Rahman, M.

Among the organisms responsible for such calcification are the Corallinaceae (Rhodophyta), recognised as major contributors to the process world-wide. Hydrolithon sp. is a coralline alga that often forms rhodoliths in the Western Indian Ocean. In Zanzibar, it is commonly found in shallow lagoons, where it often grows within seagrass beds and/or surrounded by green algae such as Ulva sp. Since seagrasses in Zanzibar have recently been shown to raise the pH of the surrounding seawater during the day, and since calcification rates are sensitive to pH, which changes the saturation state of calcium carbonate, we measured the effects of pH on photosynthetic and calcification rates of this alga. It was found that pH had significant effects on both calcification and photosynthesis. While increased pH enhanced calcification rates both in the light and in the dark at pH &gt;8.6, photosynthetic rates decreased. On the other hand, an increase in dissolved CO2 concentration to similar to 26 mu mol kg(-1) (by bubbling with air containing 0.9 mbar CO2) caused a decrease in seawater pH which resulted in 20% less calcification after 5 days of exposure, while enhancing photosynthetic rates by 13%. The ecological implications of these findings is that photosynthetically driven changes in water chemistry by surrounding plants can affect calcification rates of coralline algae, as may future ocean acidification resulting from elevated atmospheric CO2.

This has major implications for many marine organisms, particularly the calcifiers. Crustose coralline algae (CA) are among the most sensitive calcifying organisms to ocean acidification. In contrast, filamentous turf algae, which compete with CCA for space on the substratum, could potentially benefit from high pCO(2) conditions, suggesting that the effects of filamentous turf on coralline algae may be amplified in a high pCO(2) environment. The effect of ocean acidification on the growth of coralline algae, however, has rarely been investigated in combination with ecological interactions such as competition with filamentous turfing algae. Here we tested the combined effects of ocean acidification and overgrowth by filamentous turf algae on CCA calcification, photosynthetic capacity and quantum yield of photosynthesis. We observed a positive effect of algal turfs on CCA calcification but a negative effect on photosynthesis in the high pCO(2) treatments, however, these effects were variable overtime. Our results have demonstrated the importance of investigating how inter-species interactions such as competition will complicate the impacts of ocean acidification. (c) 2014 Elsevier B.V.

A clear understanding of growth pattern and rate is required to interpret time-series proxy data. Variability in growth on multiple-axes of a single rhodolith has not been extensively studied. This investigation compares algal band counting and dating methods found in the literature, and has implications for detecting biases in branch selection for growth and geochemical analyses. Panamanian rhodoliths (Lithothamnion sp.) were collected at the Archipelago de Las Perlas, Gulf of Panama (GOP). Alizarin Red S (ARS) stain was used to study growth rates and banding patterns for 10 branched samples randomly selected for microcosm experiments over a 172-day period. DNA analysis was used to help determine the dominant species present in the sample group and reduce the possibility of inter-sample variation. Samples were overturned every 2weeks for a multi-axial growth test and were grown under ambient seawater conditions except for the addition of LED lighting. Growth post-ARS staining was measured along the long (A), intermediate (B), and short (C) axes. Bisected branches show banding correlated with growth rate while banding was highly variable within an individual and between individuals. Average growth band widths in both the pre- and post-ARS stained growth were approximately the same, suggesting that non-environmental factors, such as overturning or biological influences, can cause the formation of growth increments. Differences in growth pattern and rate suggest that careful inspection of growth formation is needed before pursuing rhodolith-based time series proxy research.</abstract><urls><text-urls><url>https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031018216306757</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sordo, L.</author><author>Santos, R.</author><author>Barrote, I.</author><author>Freitas, C.</author><author>Silva, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Seasonal Photosynthesis, Respiration, and Calcification of a Temperate Maerl Bed in Southern Portugal</title><secondary-title>Frontiers in Marine Science</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Frontiers in Marine Science</full-title></periodical><volume>7</volume><dates><year>2020</year><pub-dates><date>Mar 2020</date></pub-dates></dates><electronic-resource-num>10.3389/fmars.2020.00136</electronic-resource-num><research-notes>Sordo, Laura Santos, Rui Barrote, Isabel Freitas, Catia Silva, Joao&#xD;Sordo, Laura/AFT-8679-2022; Barrote, Isabel/AAK-4887-2021; Santos, Rui/B-4168-2008; Silva, Joao/J-7874-2013&#xD;Santos, Rui/0000-0002-7861-4366; Barrote, Isabel/0000-0002-0922-0259; Silva, Joao/0000-0002-7211-1661; Freitas, Catia/0000-0002-9637-3113&#xD;2296-7745&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;accession-num: WOS:000521223900001</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/marine-science/articles/10.3389/fmars.2020.00136/pdf</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sordo, L.</author><author>Santos, R.</author><author>Barrote, I.</author><author>Silva, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>High CO2 decreases the long-term resilience of the free-living coralline algae Phymatolithon lusitanicum</title><secondary-title>Ecol Evol</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecol Evol</full-title></periodical><pages>4781-4792</pages><volume>8</volume><number>10</number><issue>10</issue><keywords><keyword>calcification</keyword><keyword>coralline algae</keyword><keyword>ocean acidification</keyword><keyword>photosynthesis</keyword><keyword>respiration</keyword><keyword>long-term</keyword><keyword>photosynthetic pigments</keyword><keyword>Phymatolithon lusitanicum</keyword><keyword>southern Portugal</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2018</year><pub-dates><date>May 2018</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2045-7758 (Print) 2045-7758 (Linking)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ece3.4020</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Maerl/rhodolith beds are protected habitats that may be affected by ocean acidification (OA), but it is still unclear how the availability of CO 2 will affect the metabolism of these organisms. Some of the inconsistencies found among OA experimental studies may be related to experimental exposure time and synergetic effects with other stressors. Here, we investigated the long-term (up to 20 months) effects of OA on the production and calcification of the most common maerl species of southern Portugal, Phymatolithon lusitanicum. Both the photosynthetic and calcification rates increased with CO 2 after the first 11 months of the experiment, whereas respiration slightly decreased with CO 2. After 20 months, the pattern was reversed. Acidified algae showed lower photosynthetic and calcification rates, as well as lower accumulated growth than control algae, suggesting that a metabolic threshold was exceeded. Our results indicate that long-term exposure to high CO 2 will decrease the resilience of Phymatolithon lusitanicum. Our results also show that shallow communities of these rhodoliths may be particularly at risk, while deeper rhodolith beds may become ocean acidification refuges for this biological community.</abstract><research-notes>Sordo, Laura&#xD;Santos, Rui&#xD;Barrote, Isabel&#xD;Silva, Joao&#xD;eng&#xD;England&#xD;Ecol Evol. 2018 Apr 16;8(10):4781-4792. doi: 10.1002/ece3.4020. eCollection 2018 May.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: Marine Plant Ecology Research Group Centre of Marine Sciences (CCMAR) University of Algarve Faro Portugal.&#xD;edition: 2018/06/08&#xD;accession-num: 29876057</research-notes><urls><text-urls><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29876057</url><url>https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5980507/pdf/ECE3-8-4781.pdf</url></text-urls></urls></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Sordo, L.</author><author>Santos, R.</author><author>Barrote, I.</author><author>Silva, J.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Temperature amplifies the effect of high CO2 on the photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification of the coralline algae Phymatolithon lusitanicum</title><secondary-title>Ecol Evol</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecol Evol</full-title></periodical><pages>11000-11009</pages><volume>9</volume><number>19</number><issue>19</issue><keywords><keyword>calcification</keyword><keyword>ocean acidification</keyword><keyword>photosynthesis</keyword><keyword>temperature</keyword><keyword>maerl</keyword><keyword>respiration</keyword><keyword>Coralline algae</keyword><keyword>Co2</keyword><keyword>heat wave</keyword></keywords><dates><year>2019</year><pub-dates><date>Oct 2019</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>2045-7758 (Print) 2045-7758 (Linking)</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1002/ece3.5560</electronic-resource-num><abstract>The combination of ocean acidification (OA) and global warming is expected to have a significant effect on the diversity and functioning of marine ecosystems, particularly on calcifying algae such as rhodoliths (maerl) that form extensive beds worldwide, from polar to tropical regions. In addition, the increasing frequency of extreme events, such as heat waves, threatens coastal ecosystems and may affect their capacity to fix blue carbon. The few studies where the simultaneous effects of both temperature and CO2 were investigated have revealed contradictory results. To assess the effect that high temperature spells can have on the maerl beds under OA, we tested the short-time effects of temperature and CO2 on the net photosynthesis, respiration, and calcification of the recently described species Phymatolithon lusitanicum, the most common maerl species of southern Portugal. Photosynthesis, calcification, and respiration increased with temperature, and the differences among treatments were enhanced under high CO2. We found that in the short term, the metabolic rates of Phymatolithon lusitanicum will increase with CO2 and temperature as will the coupling between calcification and photosynthesis. However, under high CO2, this coupling will favor photosynthesis over calcification, which, in the long term, can have a negative effect on the blue carbon fixing capacity of the maerl beds from southern Portugal.</abstract><research-notes>Sordo, Laura&#xD;Santos, Rui&#xD;Barrote, Isabel&#xD;Silva, Joao&#xD;eng&#xD;England&#xD;Ecol Evol. 2019 Sep 13;9(19):11000-11009. doi: 10.1002/ece3.5560. eCollection 2019 Oct.&#xD;&#xD;The following values have no corresponding Zotero field:&#xD;auth-address: Marine Plant Ecology Research Group, Centre of Marine Sciences (CCMAR) University of Algarve Faro Portugal.

Clathromorphum nereostratum and Clathromorphum compactum are the primary builders of carbonate-hardgrounds in the Aleutians Islands of Alaska and North Atlantic shelf, respectively, providing habitat and settlement substrates for a large number of species. We exposed wild-collected specimens to 12 pCO2/T treatments (344–3322 μatm; 6.38–12.40°C) for 4 months in a factorially crossed, replicated laboratory experiment. Impacts of pCO2/T on algal calcification were quantified from linear extension and buoyant weight. Here we show that, despite belonging to the same genus, C. nereostratum exhibited greater sensitivity to thermal stress, while C. compactum exhibited greater sensitivity to pH stress. Furthermore, multivariate models of algal calcification derived from the experiment indicate that both C. nereostratum and C. compactum will commence net dissolution as early as 2120 and 2200 AD, respectively. Our results therefore indicate that near-term climate change may lead to substantial degradation of these species and loss of the critical hardground habitats that they form. © 2022.

While there is an increasing number of publications on CCA every year, it is evident that there are many misunderstandings and inconsistencies in the assignment of CCA to taxonomic and functional groups. This is partly because CCA are treated by biologists, ecologists and palaeontologists as well as covered by studies published in journals ranging from geo- to biosciences, so that there is often a mixture of terminology used and differing scientific focus. In this review, a comprehensive overview is given on what is known about CCA, their functional traits and their roles in environments from the present and the past. In this context, some bridges are built between the commonly different viewpoints of ecologists and palaeontologists, including suggesting a common and straightforward terminology, highlighting and partially merging different taxonomic viewpoints as well as summarizing the most important functional traits of CCA. Ideally, future studies should seek to quantitatively analyse potential implications for CCA and their associated organisms under ongoing global change.</abstract><remote-database-name>DOI.org (Crossref)</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://link.springer.com/10.1007/s10347-024-00682-1</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/ZQXE3ZFE/Teichert - 2024 - Attached and free-living crustose coralline algae .pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2025-06-25 13:33:51</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Van Der Heijden, L.

Reduction of CO2 to a sustainable level is required to avoid further marine change. Many studies investigate the potential of marine carbon sinks (e.g. seagrass) to mitigate anthropogenic emissions, however, information on storage by coralline algae and the beds they create is scant. Calcifying photosynthetic organisms, including coralline algae, can act as a CO2 sink via photosynthesis and CaCO3 dissolution and act as a CO2 source during respiration and CaCO3 production on short-term timescales. Longterm carbon storage potential might come from the accumulation of coralline algae deposits over geological timescales. Here, the carbon storage potential of coralline algae is assessed using meta-analysis of their global organic and inorganic carbon production and the processes involved in this metabolism. Net organic and inorganic production were estimated at 330 g C m−2 yr−1 and 900 g CaCO3 m−2 yr−1 respectively giving global organic/inorganic C production of 0.7/1.8 × 109 t C yr−1. Calcium carbonate production by free-living/crustose coralline algae (CCA) corresponded to a sediment accretion of 70/450 mm kyr−1. Using this potential carbon storage for coralline algae, the global production of free-living algae/CCA was 0.4/1.2 × 109 t C yr−1 suggesting a total potential carbon sink of 1.6 × 109 tonnes per year. Coralline algae therefore have production rates similar to mangroves, salt marshes and seagrasses representing an as yet unquantiﬁed but signiﬁcant carbon store, however, further empirical investigations are needed to determine the dynamics and stability of that store.</abstract><remote-database-name>DOI.org (Crossref)</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://bg.copernicus.org/articles/12/6429/2015/</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/ZI46XG98/Van Der Heijden und Kamenos - 2015 - Reviews and syntheses Calculating the global cont.pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2025-06-25 13:35:12</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Spencer Davies, P.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Short-term growth measurements of corals using an accurate buoyant weighing technique</title><secondary-title>Marine Biology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Marine Biology</full-title><abbr-1>Marine Biology</abbr-1></periodical><pages>389-395</pages><volume>101</volume><number>3</number><issue>3</issue><keywords><keyword>Alizarin</keyword><keyword>Biomineralization</keyword><keyword>Bone Development</keyword><keyword>Bone Physiology</keyword><keyword>Coral Reefs</keyword><keyword>Coral Tissue</keyword><keyword>Hyperdontia</keyword><keyword>Intrauterine growth</keyword><keyword>Linear Extension</keyword><keyword>Skeletal Growth</keyword><keyword>Turbid Water</keyword></keywords><dates><year>1989</year><pub-dates><date>1989-05-01</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1432-1793</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.1007/BF00428135</electronic-resource-num><abstract>An accurate method for determining the growth rates of the skeleton of isolated branch tips (nubbins) of corals over intervals of less than 24 h is described. The skeletal weight of the coral was estimated from its buoyant weight in seawater whose density had been accurately determined. The coral tissues accounted for between 1 and 5% of the total buoyant weight in Pocillopora verrucosa and Acropora humilis with differing relative tissue biomass. After correcting for tissue buoyant weight, predictions of skeletal weight were accurate to within 1%. The method was used to estimate the growth of sample nubbins of Porites porites of similar diameter, in 2 m of water at Discovery Bay, Jamaica. Since growth of these branch tips is apical, growth rate could be expressed without correction for the size. The mean 24 h skeletal growth rate ranged between 40 and 47 mg. Differences could be measured between day-time and night-time growth, the day: night ratio being 3.7. The method also showed that P. porites virtually ceases calcification during the 4 to 5 d periods that it becomes enclosed in a mucus tunic. Nubbins of P. porites attached to the reef at different locations showed clear differences in growth rate with depth, and between clear and turbid water sites. The growth rate of nubbins was compared with that of branch tips of whole corals by measuring the linear extension after staining with Alizarin Red S. After 3 1/2 mo, the mean linear extension was 4.1 mm in each case, indicating that the growth rate of nubbins is the same as that of branch tips of the whole colony. It is suggested that this buoyant weighing technique will find applications in laboratory experiments with calcification mechanisms and as a bioassay on reefs exposed to environmental stress.</abstract><remote-database-name>Springer Link</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://doi.org/10.1007/BF00428135</url></web-urls><pdf-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/DBCGHXZX/Spencer Davies - 1989 - Short-term growth measurements of corals using an .pdf</url></pdf-urls></urls><access-date>2025-06-27 23:50:45</access-date></record><record><database name="MyLibrary">MyLibrary</database><source-app name="Zotero">Zotero</source-app><ref-type name="Journal Article">17</ref-type><contributors><authors><author>Marsh Jr., James A.</author></authors></contributors><titles><title>Primary Productivity of Reef-Building Calcareous Red Algae</title><secondary-title>Ecology</secondary-title></titles><periodical><full-title>Ecology</full-title></periodical><pages>255-263</pages><volume>51</volume><number>2</number><issue>2</issue><dates><year>1970</year><pub-dates><date>1970</date></pub-dates></dates><isbn>1939-9170</isbn><electronic-resource-num>10.2307/1933661</electronic-resource-num><abstract>Primary productivity of reef—building algae was studied by putting samples from the reef in a closed system and measuring oxygen exchange in the light and in the dark. Gross productivity determined for 32 samples in full sunlight had a mean value of 0.048 mg O2 cm—2 hr—1. Photosynthesis was found to increase with the logarithm of light intensity up to 1,000 ft—c and was constant between 1,000 and 8,000 ft—c. Rates of gas exchange in flowing water showed no correlation with water velocity but were greater than rates in still water. Daily patterns of photosynthesis were calculated for populations of calcareous algae living on the submarine faces of the windward sides of atolls. During most of the daylight hours light is probably not a limiting factor for photosynthesis in these populations. Calculated productivity of various calcareous algal zones indicates that these do not contribute significantly to overall reef production on atolls of the northern Marshall Islands. Island reefs are less productive than previously studied inter—island reefs.</abstract><remote-database-name>Wiley Online Library</remote-database-name><language>en</language><urls><web-urls><url>https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.2307/1933661</url></web-urls><text-urls><url>/Users/katrineckardt/Zotero/storage/R3C6FTLN/1933661.html</url></text-urls></urls><access-date>2025-06-28 00:09:41</access-date></record></records></xml>
