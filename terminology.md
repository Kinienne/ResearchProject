# Terminology
In my table I use a lot of short keywords that will be explained in the following so that everyone understands the singular categories.

#### Paper
This is simply the original paper from which all the information in the line are from.
#### Year
This is the year of the original paper. This is a separate column for statistical tests.
#### Species
If the paper talks about a specific species it will be noted here.
#### Type/Morphology
This is the "type" of crustose coralline algae that is worked with.
- **Rhodolith**: Rhodoliths do not attach themselves to the rocky seabed. Rather, they roll like tumbleweeds along the seafloor until they become too large in size to be mobilised by the prevailing wave and current regime.
- **Maerl**: Non-geniculate coralline red algae that have a certain growth pattern.
- **CCA**: Undefined crustose coralline algae.
- **Geniculate**: Coralline red algae that have a tree like growth pattern.
#### Location
The site at which the samples were collected.
#### Ocean/Sea
The ocean or sea from which the samples stem from.
#### Latitude
The latitude of the sampling site.
#### Longitude
The longitude of the sampling site.
#### Water depth [m]
This is the depth at which the samples were collected. This is given in metres.
#### Carbonate production g/m^2 * yr
This is the exact carbonate production given in the paper.
#### Method growth/calcification rate
In this section are the methods used for calculating/determinating the calcification rate (also called growth rate).
#### Method carbonate production
The methods used for calculating/determinating the carbonate production. In most cases it builds upon the previous results of the calcification rates.
#### Study-type
The conditions under which the study was conducted. 
- **Laboratory**: Under laboratory conditions.
- **Field**: In the field during an expedition.
#### Data-source
The source of the data.
- **Literature**: Data is from another paper and used for a huge portion of the paper.
- **Calculated**: Data is recovered during the research and used in the paper.
