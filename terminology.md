# Terminology
In my table I use a lot of short keywords that will be explained in the following so that everyone understands the singular categories.

#### Paper
This is simply the original paper from which all the information in the line are from.
#### Year
This is the year of the original paper. This is a separate column for statistical tests.
#### Species
If the paper talks abou a specific species it will be noted here.
#### Type/Morphology
This is the "type" of crustose coralline algae that is worked with.
- **Rhodolith**: Rhodoliths do not attach themselves to the rocky seabed. Rather, they roll like tumbleweeds along the seafloor until they become too large in size to be mobilised by the prevailing wave and current regime.
- **Maerl**: Non-geniculate coralline red algae that have a certain growth pattern.
- **CCA**: Undefined crustose coralline algae.
- **Geniculate**: Coralline red algae that have a tree like growth pattern.
#### Location
The site at which the samples were collected.
#### Ocean/Sea
The ocean or sea from which the samples stem from.
#### Latitude
The latitude of the sampling site.
#### Longitude

#### Water depth [m]
