**Description**: Coralline red algae are important ecosystem engineers, and there is increasing international recognition of the global significance of rhodolith beds, as well as their potential as blue carbon. One key aspect is carbonate production rates; however, due to differences in methodologies, direct comparison has so far been difficult. This project will compare and evaluate existing methodologies with the aim to methodological guidance for future studies.
